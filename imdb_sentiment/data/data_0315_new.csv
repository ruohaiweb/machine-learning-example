"Don¡¯t be fooled by the title ¨C this is not a light and fluffy romance.  In fact, it¡¯s quite serious and rather depressing, mostly due to the ML¡¯s complex, prickly personality and his situation (slowly losing his sense of taste and eventually his eyesight) as well as his psychotic business partner, Elise, who is obsessed with him to the point of poisoning him so he's dependent on her.  And if that isn¡¯t enough, Elise and her evil mom are also swindling him out of his restaurant.  One evening, he gets dead drunk, and the ugly witch (FL¡¯s name for her, not mine) makes it appear as though they¡¯ve slept together, and while he¡¯s out, she fraudulently places his thumb print on a legal document.  When dumb ass ML wakes up the next morning, he apparently thinks he¡¯s slept with her and decides to ¡®take responsibility¡¯ (at least, that¡¯s what I think he¡¯s doing) and tells her that he¡¯s willing to ¡®be with her¡¯.  Fortunately, the ugly witch has enough conscience to turn him down.  I really hate these type of MLs who, because of some relationship in the past or present, passively allow toxic women to cling to them like barnacles, causing strife in his relationship with FL¡­but heck, it¡¯s ain¡¯t a C-drama without one of these harpies.  I much prefer the rude MLs who treats these women as they should be treated ¨C like toxic waste.  On top of all of this, ML has a professional rival actively looking for ways to humiliate and defeat him.  

This drama is just full of lot of manipulation, psychotic behavior, deceit, back-stabbing, poor sportsmanship, revenge, unethical practices, etc., and there¡¯s very little romance to make up for all the angst.  ML/FL remind me more of a master and his seeing eye dog than lovers, and it takes forever for them to even get to the point of being a couple.  He¡¯s dealing with his medical condition and all the angst caused by the ugly witch and his professional rival while FL is hung up on her ¡®crush¡¯, the idiot playboy, Song Yiran, who ends up with his brother¡¯s pick for his wife anyway.  Honestly, the best part of the drama for me was the song/dance at the very end.

FL, at least, came across as reasonably mature, despite her age.  There was no cutesy behavior such as baby talk or pouting, and she was a solid support for ML as he went through his trials¡­much of it brought upon himself for trusting that psycho business partner¡­and no, I didn¡¯t feel sorry for her as she struggled with her evil deeds.  As for the rest of the characters, I¡¯m not going to waste my time commenting.  The good news is ¨C this drama does manage to have a happy ending although far from satisfactory, in my opinion.  The villains (Elise, evil mom, doctor, Elise's brother, FL's cousin) do not get properly punish for their evil deeds, which gives out a horrible message.  Forgiveness is admirable but that doesn't mean you allow criminals to escape the punishment they rightly deserve.  ML nearly dies because of what Elise and the doc does to him so they should have been punished...and no, going into exile in Europe is not proper punishment!

I suppose it was an interesting story if you like angst-filled dramas that make you feel more depressed than light-hearted.  For me, it wasn¡¯t my cup of tea because I watch dramas to escape a reality which already has enough of angst in it.  The premise of this drama was very similar to ¡®Instead of Tipsy Why Not Get Drunk¡¯ (also available on Viki) in which a wine expert loses his sense of taste via an accidental kiss and must train the girl who stole his sense of taste to analyze wines on his behalf.  I recommend Tipsy over Cupid¡¯s Kitchen if this plot line appeals to you ¨C it¡¯s not depressing, and there¡¯s plenty of sweet romance between the leads."
"I totally agree with mz_jugni. I will add my own comments later.

""I love this show too much! I¡¯m generally more fond of Korean dramas than Chinese dramas for a few reasons. Often, Chinese dramas have so many episodes that the central story gets watered down. Also, while I understand the reason for dubbing in Chinese dramas, the quality can sometimes be sub par and distracting. And, lastly, I personally feel that in an effort to make the FL seem strong and independent, she will often comes across (again, in my opinion) as a prickly, pouting obstinate child. However, in this drama, I¡¯m feeling none of that frustration. Yes, the FL is young and often immature, but she is also thoughtful and sincere. She gives off a vibe that gives me a reason to look forward to watching her character develop and grow as a chef and as a woman. And the chemistry between the ML and the FL is amazing. I hate that there are so many evil people in the drama, but I guess it adds some spice. I just wish I didn¡¯t have to patiently wait for each new episode. This is a series I¡¯d love to spend a weekend binge watching. Oh, and did I mention the ML looks totally hot in his chef¡¯s uniform?

Update¡­while I still love this show and can¡¯t wait to see how it all gets tied up in the end, I¡¯m getting super frustrated with the number of truly evil people in this show who continue to face no consequences for their actions, and worse, that the show tries to normalize them. I won¡¯t go into detail, but if these people hadn¡¯t done such bad things to other people, their side stories would be delightful. But at this point, I can¡¯t enjoy any of it because I¡¯m gritting my teeth wondering when/if they are going to get the punishment they deserve.

Update #2¡­I found this show elsewhere and finished it over the weekend. And I have to say, I have mixed feelings about the ending. Personally, I would have preferred different resolutions for some of the characters. But, I loved the main couple, and I¡¯d watch them again in another show. """

"This show could have been better.
It has a potentially good script, and most of the cast is good enough to carry it; it also has great visuals and photography dedicated to the art of cooking, which is the best element that's being integrated in the narrative... however, this show drastically falls to a 5 stars (should've been 4, but kept one for the female lead and Boris' actor, Alexei Lezev) because it gives out a very wrong message.

Most people got fed up of this show precisely due to one of the factors that contributes to send out this harmful message: Elise. Leaving aside the obvious lacking skills of the actress that portrays her (that can always improve), the character is drawn a certain way but it doesn't get solved realistically. It happens the same with her mother, Jessica (?) Quentin, and a little bit with Kesong's cousin, Xiaoyu.

The premise is that Elise is a psychotic woman who is obsessed with Qianfang/Oliver, the male lead. Because no one that decides to do what she does can be in her right state of mind (and not talking about an illness but a true psychopathy, fuelled by a real narcissistic nature). Her mother is a vicious woman with very bad morals, and her brother also lacks some nobility while being extremely arrogant.

Elise decides to poison the man she is obsessed with, so he will get dependant on her and won't have any other choice but to be entangled (romantically) to her. Her mother applauds her when she discovers she's behind Qianfang's loss of taste and even instigates and coaxes her to steal his shares from the bussiness they built together. Victor, the brother, cheats at one point of the cooking competition that occupies grand part of this drama, but he never gets reported not caught by the survilliance cameras that conveniently did work when Kesong (the female lead) ends up fighting with her cousin Xiaoyu... well, everything is too forced for plot device and, I get this comes from a certain genre of Chinese romance novels, but this is not a webtoon, this should be believable and try not to spread the message that if you commit crimes you'll go unpunished. Especially when they've spent such a huge budget on making it look like a HQ drama.

The drama has 40 episodes that could had been 30 or could had been 40 but without dragging certain plotlines this much and showing more of the cooking competition and each contestants (the ones they chose to focus on) journey. To be honest, I stopped caring about Song Yirang (Kesong's initial love interest) too soon and, I must admit, his back-story was one trully interesting due to his hedonistic nature and the reason why the kid behaved so immaturely. But it just got boring.

What I can't fathom is that these dramas go through censorship that cuts on a lot of things that shouldn't be persecuted anywhere in the World, yet it gets a free pass to presenting 3 criminals (Elise, her mother and the unethical doctor) that end up not only going unpunished and without any karma lesson to learn, they even get to save the day! Out of them three, the ones that pssd me off the most were Miss Quenting and the doctor. That doctor shouldn't be allowed to excercise, and Elise's mother should had got some karma coming for her, even if she didn't get caught commiting fraud with how she got Qianfang's ""signature"" to steal his shares.

Elise ""karmic"" journey of feeling super guilty and repentant is not coherent. She is a psycho, nobody that would chose to do what she did can be a person that's not absolutely twisted and harmful. They even showed us how she continuesly gaslighted and tried to manipulate him, how are we to believe she's just a woman who made the wrong choice? She just kepts commiting crime after crime once she realizes it is too late, yet the drama ends and she's no way behind bars. Not even after Qianfang discovers the truth himself.

Despite other aspects of the story were good and worth watching, even the dispared romance (due to the high age difference), since both leads made it work decently; this drama felt like a fraud once it reached its end without the true evildoers recieving what they deserved."
"Food, glorious food! This could have been so much better if they just stuck to that theme but alas, the writer took us down the garden path, deep dive a dank rabbit hole, before magically transported us to the Fairy meadow where the unicorns are frolicking like they were on drugs.
Any reader who has watched the original Karate Kid (and similar movie/show) would recognise the central plot. In this case, instead of martial arts, we have culinary arts. A Michelin star chef needs to find and train a new apprentice, but that person must have a supernatural sense of taste. Of course, this was not done through the kindness of his heart but because he is losing his own ability to taste food, so he needed that someone to taste for him when he creates new dishes. All this is hushed up so people were confused when he decided to mentor a girl (FL) who accidentally entered a top tier cooking competition but can¡¯t cook at all. To compound his woes, he is quite a prickly character and very temperamental. In essence, a stereotypical master craftsman/creative type. All the classic clich¨¦s were deployed included the equivalent of the old wax-on-wax-off training trick to bring the hapless FL to some semblance of proficiency. However, this is a rom-com so the tale as old as time was given its due and the master/apprentice relationship took on a much more personal spin. 
Speaking of food and cooking, this show has so much food porn. From street food to eateries serving local delicacies and all the way up to Michelin star restaurant. The food was a highlight, and those dishes were shot with skill and a singular focus. I do wonder whether the production team hired a food stylist and specialist photographer. This ended up being the saving grace of the show and I gave it extra marks.
You may well say there is nothing wrong with that storyline, sounds quite interesting and delicious. That is indeed the case, if they stick to it. However, into that pot were added several antagonists as well as dramatic change in tones. I mean descent into madness type of change. Most of this came from left field so what started as a light and breezy rom-com got darker and darker until you thought you were watching a different genre. 
The OTP is an odd couple but when all the romantic ducklings are lined up, they can be quite sweet and engaging. You can't deny there is chemistry between them. Towards the end, there are truly swoon worthy moments. It would be tempting fate if this was the only game in town. We are confronted with the typical Chinese rom-com probl¨¨me du jour, what I'd like to term Too Many Cooks Syndrome. On top of the OTP, there are 5 other CP¡¯s! (Is that a record?) Most of the pairings are contrived and does little for the show other than padding out the runtime and force a change of scenery. This is particularly jarring when the show got darker and more intense. We¡¯d suddenly flip to a CP and watch them do the mating dance or deal with some trivial matter. 
All these extraneous stuffs would just be fluff if the show didn¡¯t do a 180 on itself at the 7/8 mark. Every antagonist was reformed. Every problem (except the one concerning the ML) is swept aside. It made a mockery of all the angst and misdeeds that was dished out over the last 30 odd episodes. Some were explained away as historical misunderstanding, but more was left unanswered and frankly, baffling. This was quite strange as the bulk of the show was rooted in reality (cooking is about as real as it can get). When the ML was challenged by reporters as to how he can still be a master chef when he can¡¯t even taste his own food, the writer finessed a clever and logical solution. It only served to highlight the inconsistency later on.
Around that 7/8 mark, we also have an attack of the unicorns as well. We are talking a herd of them. The last few episodes were all about tying every loose end up with pink bows. Happy endings were served to everyone, whether they deserved it or not. This was topped by a Deus Ex Machina solution straight out of a wuxia/xianxia drama. It is as if the writer has abandoned reality, just went all in and damn the consequences. The piece de resistance was the ending. It needs a health warning for diabetics. It was sugar overload. I won¡¯t spoil it, just one hint, Bollywood.
Acting is generally solid but some were exaggerated stereotypes, especially concerning foreigners. Younger actors have room to improve but they show a lot of commitment even when it was an unrewarding role. 
OST and production values were good. It would have scored better if the writer stays focused and kept its message clear. Make it sweet and bubbly or dark and crazy but what we ended up is a rollercoaster ride that looped back on itself and make us feel cheated and confused. Individual scenes can be well executed and acted but the whole is, regrettably, less than the sum of the parts.  "
"N?o deveria ser classificado como um romance. DEVERIA SER PSI- DRAMA 

Era para ser um c-drama romantico e leve, usando o mundo da gastronomia como pano de fundo, mas, na verdade, n?o passa de uma hist¨®ria de uma mo?a sem um pingo de autoestima manipulada por seu mentor. =/

A protagonista (FL) ¨¦ muito gente boa e  engra?ada, mas totalmente sem autoestima. Ela deixa um monte de gente pisar no pesco?o dela. 

O protagonista (ML), um chef asqueroso, egoc¨ºntrico e manipulador. Ele faz da vida da Kesong um inferno, e sempre quando ela tentava se afastar dele, ele fazia agrados para manter o controle sobre a vida dela.

Ao longo de 40 fucking epis¨®dios, Jiang Qianfang s¨® se mostrou um arrogante e pretensioso chef de cozinha. 
Em sequ¨ºncia a gente pode testemunhar ele mandar a Kesong dormir num escrit¨®rio residencial sem privacidade, regular o hor¨¢rio de banho, confiscar telefone, observar a garota por cameras de vigilancia da pr¨®pria casa, gritar com ela, jogar objetos para intimid¨¢-la, al¨¦m de privar a alimenta??o caso ela n?o obede?a as regras. E deixar bem claro que odeia mentiras, demitindo Liu Yang e a Nina de forma arbitr¨¢ria... UM COMPLETO BABACA HIP¨®CRITA! Porque a verdadeira vil? era a Elisa, e assim que descobriu a verdade, passou pano pra ela, perdoou rapidamente o crime dela  e ela foi embora para outro pa¨ªs como se nada tivesse acontecido.

Enfim, Kesong n?o passa de um instrumento poderoso de trabalho para Qianfang...Ele nunca amou ela de verdade. E ela ficou totalmente manipulada por ele. Inclusive, se afastou at¨¦ do amigo de infancia, numa posi??o de humilha??o profunda esperando migalhas de elogios de Qianfang porque ""foi o ¨²nico que reconheceu o valor dela"" AAAAAHHHHH, sifud¨§ !!!!!!!! // Nota 5. Os outros 5 pontos s?o pelas comidas. "
"I'll reserve my true rating after I watch the whole show. However, I really must address the constant friction between people complaining about subtitles and people supporting the volunteers who do them and attacking subscribers who complain.

All of you are really looking at the wrong culprit.

Blame VIKI. They have set up the model where volunteers do the subtitles. Sure is cheaper for them. On the other hand? There are millions of subscribers all over the world paying exorbitant subscription fees for ACTUAL SERVICE they don't get!! When I realized that I pay more for VIKI subscription than NETFLIX, it really hacked me off! NETFLIX never makes subscribers wait for translations, nor does the company drag the episodes out interminably. Shouldn't we all demand that VIKI ACT LIKE A GENUINE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE, maybe even pay the translators a stipend at least?! I've considered many times dropping VIKI, especially now that there are so many choices for programming and even NETFLIX is picking up lots of Asian content. Someday I'm probably going to keep my money and look elsewhere!"
"Tr¨¨s bien interpr¨¦t¨¦. M¨ºme si je trouve certains traits exag¨¦r¨¦s, j'ai aim¨¦. Premi¨¨re fois depuis tr¨¨s longtemps que j'ai une vague compassion pour la personne qui s'est tr¨¨s mal comport¨¦e et a trahi l'un de ses proches. J'imagine que le remord el la culpabilit¨¦ ressentis contrebalancent,  dans une certaine mesure,  l'ignominie de leur acte. Le pardon n'est toujours pas mon truc, l'absence de punition s¨¦rieuse m'agace, mais pour une fois je ne suis pas furieux. Je pense que le jeu des acteurs et la sinc¨¦rit¨¦ des ¨¦motions qu'ils ont jou¨¦s m'ont touch¨¦s plus que d'habitude. Je met donc une excellente note pour ce qu'il m'a fait ressentir."
"It wasn¡¯t too bad. It kept my interest throughout all 40 episodes.  I liked that the female lead remained her spunky self throughout the entire show.  She didn¡¯t turn all wishy-washy once she realized her feelings for Oliver (the male lead).

It is a cookie cutter c-drama rom com. Everything worked out well for Eve EY one in the end.  
The show managed to keep the corny-ness to a minimum throughout the whole show until the last half of episode40. Then the show just went 100% corny with the musical number. I wished they hadn¡¯t done that!  It would have been so much better without it!"
"Cupid's Skippable Kitchen

**Spoilers are at the bottom**

This is a Food drama with a pinch of comedy and a very little sprinkle of romance. If you are looking for food then this is the right drama for you. If you¡¯re looking for romance then look elsewhere. This just isn¡¯t it.

For The Good, For the Bad¡­

For the Good:
1. Colorful Cutscenes - They only did a few of these non-food-related cutscenes but they were beautiful. I was really hoping to see more of them.
2. High-Quality Food Cutscenes - There are a lot of these and although I enjoyed them. They didn¡¯t feel as satisfying as the ones in Dating In The Kitchen
3. The Leads - Both are really good actors. I really enjoyed watching them. If not for them I¡¯m not sure I would have watched all 40 episodes.
4. The OST is very nice

For The Bad:
1. Slow-paced - Its very slow-paced and the side stories make it even slower. Other than the first 5 and the last 5 episodes, I found this drama pretty boring.
2. Huge Lack of Heart-Flutters - Where¡¯s the intimacy? I¡¯m not even talking about kisses. Just moments that make you feel like the leads are falling in love. I certainly felt that they cared for each other but there seemed to be a huge lack of romance.
3. Boring side-stories - Honestly, I wound up skipping through most of the side stories because they were just so boring, and other than the character knowing the leads, their stories really didn¡¯t affect them or the plot in any real way.
5. Evil/Bad Character overload - Honestly who isn¡¯t a bad character other than the leads and a few others. However, none of them were as bad as the 2FL who clearly needs mental help. The method she used to try to stay with the ML is one of the most psychotic I¡¯ve ever seen. She¡¯s a basket case and the worst part is that she¡¯s surrounded by enablers. (More on her in the spoilers below)
6. The 2FL Dubbing - Everyone else in the drama is fine but for some reason, her dubbing is not only obvious but it doesn¡¯t match her mouth movement at all. For all the beautiful production they have in this drama, they very obviously dropped the ball on her dubbing.



***Spoilers Below***




I really disliked the way the ML took out his frustrations on the FL. I know he is going through something pretty rough but why did he need to yell at her the way he did and more than once. I know he¡¯s devastated over losing his sense of taste but that¡¯s not the FL¡¯s fault.

In fact, it¡¯s the 2FL¡¯s fault and for some reason instead of thoroughly investigating her. Even when she¡¯s suspiciously asking him if he could forgive the person who poisoned him. The ML even fires his longtime live-in cleaning lady. Someone who was like family to him but he keeps the 2FL around. Furthermore, when he does find out it was her, he completely lets her off the hook!! Like what?!!!

Another thing that really annoyed me was the ML¡¯s doctor friend who not only hides the fact that the 2FL poisoned the ML into losing his tastebuds and at risk of losing the rest of his senses, but he only enabled her and helps her hide it from being exposed. He deserves to lose his license to practice medicine and go to jail another with the 2FL. I have no sympathy for him no matter how much he likes the 2FL.

It annoys me that no one got in any sort of real trouble for their bad behavior. Everything is sunshine and rainbows at the end.

The cutest thing in this romance drama is probably the husky puppy in the last episode¡­

Would Not Recommend
Would Not Re-Watch"
"Un 5 xq fue mitad adorable y mitad muchas cosas malas juntas que desbordaron en un terrible final y no lo digo x el extra?o tipo musical que es lo de menos. Los actores, a excepci¨®n de quien hizo de Elise, fueron muy buenos y hubo conexi¨®n con los leads. Agregar¨¦ m¨¢s luego ya que ahorita corr¨ª a escribir tras un terrible final y no queria dejarlo pasar para luego olvidarlo.."
"tbh, it's the first Chinese drama that I can put up with for 40 episodes. maybe because ethan juan is absolutely delicious. by the end, everyone got redeemed though I still think else should have spent years in prison. all cast members did a good job. the musical ending was a surprise. cute but felt like it didn't belong."
No geral foi bom. Mas faltou qu¨ªmica tanto do casal principal como do secund¨¢rio. Foi um drama mais sobre comida do que sobre romance. O que deixou transparecer mais foi que a protagonista poderia ficar com o amigo j¨¢ que o mesmo descobriu que tamb¨¦m gostava dela. Ele n?o vai pra lista dos TOPS.
"What a surprisingly enjoyable show!? Ethan Juan and Song Zu Er really play off each other very well and the acting seems unforced and natural.? I¡¯ve never seen either of them in anything else but I¡¯m hugely impressed so will definitely be viewing their other work.? The story is flowing along nicely at the moment and the romance element is a slow simmer sort (no pun intended!).??

The English subtitles are a bit slow but I¡¯m happy to watch without them enjoying the facial expressions, body language and camera work, and believe it or not it is really easy to follow along.? When the subs are ready, I watch it back again to make sure I¡¯ve not missed anything.

Big round of applause to the director for the tantalising cooking scenes!? The only downside is I¡¯m salivating, not to mention starving, the whole time I¡¯m watching. Food porn¡­..love it!"
"Even w/o any subtitles yet this series looks amazing.  I can¡¯t wait to tune in again with all the translations.  And, Ethan looks freaking sexy in this series.

Update:  Finished this incredible drama on YouTube.  Great chemistry between the main leads.  I also love the plot/pace of this awesome drama.  The food/visuals in this series are definitely mind blowing.  It¡¯s definitely a different concept/storyline from ¡°Dating In The Kitchen.¡±  

 I agree with a lot of the viewers that the writers focused too much on the evil doers and not enough on the main leads.  Despite that setback this was an absolute joy to watch.  I¡¯ve read a lot of negative comments, but everyone has different opinions on what is entertaining to them.  So, give it a shot!  I tend to watch a lot of Ethan Juan flicks since I think he¡¯s a remarkable actor.  I will support him regardless.?? "
"I love very much this show. Very good actor... ML wow! He is amazing, I will definitely check for more show with him. 

I can't give 10 stars because of these three characters.

When I know that is Elise who poisoned  Jiang Quian for ""selfinesh"" I was really, really piss off and I hate her so much. The scripters invented this reason, but for me they treated the subject insensitively and not for a """"""""good"""""""" reason. Sorry but, to poisoned someone for rely on you this is a psychotic and obsessive problem, not for selfinesh.  

The obsessive Xiayu made me unconfortable and sometime piss off. She really have a big problem with her self-esteem. So I'm ""glad"" she have this incident, because her father could not control her or make her listen reason... so I think she need a this big experience for she could understand that her behavior was inconceivable.

Boris, dear, dear Boris... he was not easy to watch him. Good thing at the near end he change his mindset and become more soft, joyfull and not angry with the world. 

So because of these characters the serie was not fun sometime and this is why I rate 8 /10. 

But apart from that, this is a really good serie, make me cry a lot at the ending. The flow was good here too, cause 40 episodes it's a long serie and some serie put filler for (I don't know why they do that) extend their show, but not this one. Very concrete."
"I like watching dramas that feature cooking and this one didn't disappoint in that regard.  Chinese cooking is actually pretty complex. 

This series dragged on and could have been a few episodes shorter.

The characters:
1)  Lin Ke Song:  her ""kind"" personality went a bit too far.  If someone stabbed me in the back more than once, even if it was family, the relationship is done.  It's like she never learned or put two and two together.  Being forgiving is one thing, but in the leading lady's case, I think she could have knocked her cousin down a peg or two without resorting to the same despicable means -- this would have better shown how she is maturing.

2)  Jiang Qian Fan:  overall played his part well.  I can't imagine being a chef and then losing your sense of taste and your sight.  I don't think he and the leading lady had any chemistry which was huge for this series as the storyline has them spending so much time together.  This story seemed to have missed the building of feelings between the two characters.  We saw a bit of it with Lin Ke Song, but with Jiang Qian Fan, it was blurted out at the end.

3)  Elise:  by far the worst performer in this series.  Too phoeny, seemed like she tried too hard to convey her emotions in all of her scenes and it just came off un-naturally awkward.  Too much dubbing for her character that was badly out of sync.

4)  Lin Xiao Yu:  it is inherent in her personality that she ended up doing what she did and Boris' style of 'teaching' just brought those malicious feelings and actions to the surface.

5)  Boris:  eccentric and played his part well.  Came clean at the right time.

6)  Victor:  the only character that, I think, matured throughout the series.  He started off vicious by switching Lin Ke Song's ingredient in the first competition, but when he learned the truth of his sister's actions, he didn't agree with it, but due to family loyalty, he kept silent.  

7)  JunBin:  this character was a doctor -- in all the other Chinese medical dramas that I've seen, the doctors all take patient client priviledges seriously, but this guy didn't hesitate to reveal Jian Qian Fan's condition to Elise, who he has a crush on and thus also helped to cover up her crime, which makes him an accessory.

Storyline:
Having the story center around a chef who loses his sense of taste and later his sight is a huge challenge, but a good storyline.  The secondary storyline unfortunately centered around stereotypical ""scheming and plotting"" characters, namely the Quetins, which was disappointing because none of them paid for their mistakes. 

Elise should have been publicaly exposed for poisoning Jiang Qian Fan and then subsequently trying to cover her crime up.  Her attempts to steal the restaurants from Jiang Qian Fan with the encouragement from her mother should have also been exposed.  Public humiliation and a ban from the culinary industry in China should have been her punishment, but she gets off pretty much scot free and only spent a short time in jail. because Jiang Qian Fan didn't press charges.  Additionally, she should have been called out for her lies that she told about Lin Ke Song.

Elise's brother Victor should have been exposed in switching the ingredients during the first competition, which could have played a part in his aggression and over arrogance to win.

Junbin, as a doctor, should have also been exposed as trying to help Elise cover up a crime.  He should have lost his license to practice in China and then ended up leaving the country with Elise at the end.

I loved seeing all the food, but the story was just so so."
"I have watched the entire drama and only give it a 5 because of the main leads. Don¡¯t let the name deceive you into thinking this a cute rom com love story in the kitchen . ITS NOT! Lots and lots of drama, many evil, awful characters who should have criminal consequences who don¡¯t get what they are due. Main leads don¡¯t get enough screen time because so many other side stories full of people you hate.  The leads share a few lame kisses in the last few episodes and you don¡¯t even see them go on a date. The poster for this drama is so cute and the title is misleading , the Main couple does finally  get their happy ending after 40 episodes of hardship . I love the main actress but Regret watching this , I was able to watch it all because Anytime Elise, the doctor, victor, Boris and the cousin appeared on the screen I hit my fast forward button . "
I did not enjoy the cooking classes each time something was made.  I did not enjoy a few of the characters with a weak conscience.  I really do not like the way cdramas sometimes have that new relationship show up in episode 20 something.
"Starts out fine. Lots of angry ppl. Only 3 or 4 ppl can actually act. 17 episodes in and nothing gets resolved still.   There are lots of unhealthy relationships and obsessed ppl on this show. It's hard to believe how many stupid characters writers can fit in a show....and keep them stupid for a long time.  

UPDATE:
I've just finished it, and it certainly gets better closer to and at he end. I've also gone back to see what irks me so much about this show besides the unethical and immoral people. I really don't like the acting of the 2nd female lead (ex GF).  It's hard to believe that much screentime to given to the antagonist who's acting was so bad and inconsistent that it became so distracting that i hated every scene she was in.  Even her ooh so happy scene.

This story could have been so much better.  It could have skipped all the illogical evil and went with the flow of life. Make it more realistic, and it would have been so much more.  What a loss of what could have been a great piece with bad after bad unecessary drama.

I've said not to recommend before.  But changed it now to it's ok if you want to watch it. But know there are 32 episodes of unecessary drama in between the beginning and end. The food competition is better than average (good), but could be better."
"I loved the food theme and the FL, I think that if they had skipped the second female Elise it would have been a 10. Writers should have focused more on the ML and FL character development, the competition, their growing affection."
"First let me say, stop getting upset with people for not favoring something that you may absolutely love. If you don't like that someone else's review is not in favor, just keep scrolling. 

Me: I hated this drama and I am going to list some reasons as to why I came to this decision. The key words to take away is ¡°I.¡± 
I, meaning myself. 

1. I loathe the writing in this drama. The synopsis was lost on several occasions. I only enjoyed the culinary competitions.
2. Rollercoaster of unnecessary drama and emotions that did no justice to the actual storyline. This show deviated so far off track that I had to remind myself to watch the next episode. 
3. The female lead did not fit this particular drama. I don¡¯t know if it was because of the obvious age gap but she reminded me of a very young teenager. I seriously doubt that a very young and immature-looking female, is what the directors were going for. My unfavorable review is not to discredit the actress but more so the role she was cast for. 
4. The so-called bad guys never received any retribution. I prefer to watch the good guys get the last laugh. 
5. It just seems so unfinished. 
When he (ML) loses his taste and becomes blind it is later recovered in the last 20 minutes of the final episode. 
6. The second lead female assistant was the most atrocious character played by what seemed to be a very inexperienced actor. 

However, there are plenty of reasons as to why someone may love it but my cons outweighed my pros. 
I love the ML but I would prefer to watch him on something else. This was not it."
I really loved Fuyao and didn't know if I could see Ethan with anyone else. I was so happily surprised. I loved the chemistry between all the couples. I loved the cooking story. It was a gripping drama that was well acted. Bravo!
Enjoyed watching Ethan. The FL was a tad annoying in many of the episodes but was endearing towards the end. The evilness was a bit extreme and to see 180 degrees change was definitely unrealistic. I loved watching the food ¡­
This show will give you the impression that these people can be absolutely sh!t to each other but at least the food is allegedy good. The lead female almost goes full retard in each episode and she is incredibly void of emotional intelligence. Her hateful childish personality isnt funny like what the writers intend her to be. The writing is pure dogsh!t. The main plot points are the stupidest thing ever if you use your brain and ask why they even matter. Then there are the typical c#nty female characters who hate the main female character just because they're total c#nts. Elise is the biggest c#nt of them all. 
I really like it but the end miss a little like there were no justis for Li Yan  just because he is poor.  Elige just because she got money she could poison someone and is ok is just for love  I don't think so.
"I enjoyed this show a lot. Like some of the other reviewers, it bothered me how many evil characters there were in the show, some of whom experienced no consequences. On the one hand, in an ideal world, I do think that it would be great if it were possible to be this forgiving for people who commit evil deeds if they were genuine about changing, but the problem is that so often people don't want to change and I just unfortunately find it unrealistic and maybe even a bad idea if there are no consequences because of that. It's an issue of boundaries to me - there have to be some lines that people are not allowed to go past without serious consequences. I was unsatisfied with not just how lightly Elise got off, but also how many people supported her and made things easier for her and protected her while she was doing bad things. Where is the moral integrity of her mother? The doctor, Junbin?

In contrast, I was more satisfied with Boris and Xuanyu's redemptive arcs. While they did very unethical things and were lashing out with their anger, they didn't poison anyone and they did both learn their lesson."
"Love the beautiful food, the loving hearts, & the chance to change after mistakes! Actors were perfectly chosen and you could feel the chemistry. Great show. Great mantra- ¡°Love is the food for the living heart!¡±"
"I was invested in this story up until around episode 19 and then was ready to give up as the plot seemed to be getting out of control. I almost didn¡¯t start this because I am not a fan of the lead actress, however she actually did a great job of acting. Unfortunately they just had to add an annoying voice-over narration for her character which for me was kind of an insult to her acting skills. Totally unnecessary. I started watching it solely for Ethan Juan and he also did a great job with his character. It was too bad for both actors that this drama was such a mess. It was loaded with too many crazy, unrealistic villains and too many unnecessary side stories. The lead villains were the crazy Russian version of The Joker from Batman, and the psycho business partner cum ex girlfriend of the LM. They were so endlessly over-the-top crazy that it became comedic. Add to them a mother from hell, a narcissistic, ruthless son, a doctor with no ethics, and a cousin who was more likely related to Charles Manson than the sweet LL. The drama ended up being all about the evil doings of some bat-sh-t crazy antagonists and a bunch of boring, uninteresting side stories. Even the main story of the chef and apprentice kind of wandered around, with some confusing dream sequences which were just thrown in here and there. It had me fast forwarding and hoping the ending was great, but alas it was disappointing and kind of weird. The best things this drama produced were a lot of beautiful videography of food and a cute ¡®dance scene¡¯ at the end. Cupid¡¯s Kitchen was a poor title for this drama."
"Great actors with great life lessons filled with love, growth, forgiveness, and change for the better. By far this has been one of my favorite for the year so far with a great happy ending for all lead characters."
"I love this show too much!?????????? . Yes, the song Zu is young and often immature, but she is also thoughtful and sincere. She gives off a vibe that gives me a reason to look forward to watching her character develop and grow as a chef and as a woman. And the chemistry between the Ethan and the song Zu is amazing. I hate that there are so many evil people in the drama, but I guess it adds some spice. I just wish I didn¡¯t have to patiently wait for each new episode. This is a series I¡¯d love to spend a weekend binge watching. 

 I¡¯m getting super frustrated with the number of truly evil people in this show who continue to face no consequences for their actions, and worse, that the show tries to normalize them. I won¡¯t go into detail, but if these people hadn¡¯t done such bad things to other people, their side stories would be delightful. But at this point, I can¡¯t enjoy any of it because I¡¯m gritting my teeth wondering when/if they are going to get the punishment they deserve. I realy love this show  os much Thank you "
"First I will say a very special ""Thank you"" to all the camera men/ women who gave us this fantastic artistic view on all the food they filmed....they made an outstanding job and to the people who made this fantastic food...really extraordinary 
I loved this love/ cooking film a lot and everyone should really watch it.
Wounderfull actors/ actresses who gave all their talent what they have, it was delightful to watch this film...they all so awesome actors!!!
??????????????????????????"
"So far, I am enjoying this show.  I noticed  when the actors are walking there is some jerkiness.  I don't know if it is related to Viki or in the original filming.  I just know the walking is not smooth.  I will not complain about subtitles, as I am grateful for the people who provide them.  Before I complain, I will learn the language.  I am looking forward to Elise getting her just desserts (pun intended), freaking maniac"
"I really had high hopes for this one because I like the male lead in other shows.  I was hoping for the chemistry to be like Dating In The Kitchen, but I think Cupid went on vacation because he really missed the mark on this one.  There¡¯s really not much chemistry between the two leads.  I¡¯m at ep. 31 and I don¡¯t recall even a peck on the cheeks.  No stolen kisses, even though the preview showed one kiss¡­but other than that, I don¡¯t see much romance or sparks.  Who know maybe the next few episodes there is?  The other characters and/or supposed couples are ridiculous.  They are all over the place.  The main leads lack backbones.  The scene where she got locked in the car really annoyed me.  Like really? She couldn¡¯t unlock the car from the inside by pulling the lock? She had to break the window with a big wrench that just happened to be in the glove compartment? Really writers?

On a positive note, the food they made or shown in the show made my mouth water.   Either than that, I really do not think this is worth 40 ep.  dating in the Kitchen is only 24 ep and they captured more chemistry than than this, 31 ep in.  Disappointed."
"It was ok, I finished it but I probably wouldn't rewatch it.  I thought the FL should have been older.  I also thought the character Elise should have faced some consequence for what she did to the ML."
"Good: Food, omg salivating every time food is shown. Ethan, also salivating at how good looking he is haha. Of course liked how he portrayed his character too. Props to the two foreign actors Boris & Blu, who spoke Chinese throughout and acted fairly well.

Bad: The age gap is very obvious between the 2 leads. They could have played their characters in a way that the gap wasn't big. Most of the actors' voices are dubbed. The worse was Elise, if you wonder why its so bad, because she was speaking English 90% of the time. I wonder if it's done on purpose or her Chinese is not good. Her acting was very exaggerated. I don't wanna diss someone so bad, but she had quite a major role in this drama and she didn't perform well. Story/plot is not engaging enough, too many episodes. I had high hopes for a food genre romance drama, but I was disappointed."
"In the beginning I was enjoying this drama, however, the plot is getting to be ridiculous over half way through for number one.  The ML knows the character of Elise and with all the strange and weird things happening around him you would think he might consider her a problem. Secondly, the doctor siding with her. Where are his ethics? It gets to the point of being ridiculous as I said above. The directors have taken this drama down a path that prevents it from being a truly good one.

Also, the FL lead acts like a child to much for her character to be real. She takes it up to many notches and her voice comes across  in a very unpleasant way given her age.  I am not sure if the directors wanted her to do this or who's idea it was, but it s not pleasing when it continues on and on. I had to switch to other dramas several times after listening to her voice go on and on in this child like manner. Not pleasing.  

I do like the ML character for the most part and the FL lead except for her baby talk voice. It spoiled much of her character. 

I gave it a lower rating primarily due to the plot not coming together in a positive or cohesive meaningful way."
Avrei dato dieci stelle ma non ho apprezzato che Elisa non passasse il resto della sua vita in prigione. Avete fatto capire che se hai i soldi vieni premiato anzich¨¦ punito. Schifo e doppio schifo
"I saw up to episode 37 (YouTube release earlier)
In the beginning I was enjoying this drama, however, the plot is getting to be ridiculous. 
I will finish all 40 episodes only to see the main male actor, Ethan (he¡¯s a great actor, handsome and sexy)
I never saw so many villains on one drama, and they are all unpunished, the doctor and Elise are the worst ¨C also, in my opinion she is a very bad actress. 
The directors have taken this drama down a path that prevents it from being a truly good one. 
Also, the lead actress (Song Zu) acts like a child too much for her character to be real. She takes it up too many notches and her voice come across in a very unpleasant way given her age. I am not sure if the directors wanted her to do this or who's idea it was, but it¡¯s not pleasing when it continues and on. I do like her character for the most part except for her baby talk voice. It spoiled much of her character. 

I gave it a lower rating primarily due to the plot not coming together in a positive or cohesive meaningful way."
"Ten stars from me.. I was glued to this drama,  I also enjoyed the different styles of food and the cooking. BUT THE DRAMA HAD SO MUCH MORE. GREAT ENDING,  BICKERING, that  TURNS IN TO LOVE."
"Finished all the episodes somewhere else. It was good enough to go somewhere else to see what happened, but it left me very unsatisfied. Too many side stories. The romance was kind of  bland. I kept waiting for it to pick up, but it just kind of, kind of ??the whole way through. It was so unrealistic at times, I found myself thinking, who wrote this? The bad guys all got a happy ending and no one, absolutely no one, was held accountable for what they did wrong. The poor ML was unhappy and tormented 90 % of the drama and it didn¡¯t  feel like he was ever really happy even in the end.  I gave it a five because at least the writers were able to make me feel something: expectation filled by irritation! You can watch it if you want. It gets worse as it goes on, not better. I won¡¯t be watching it again."
So.. I had really high hopes for this one.. after all .. who could resist Ethan Juan from the Original Fated to Love You and Legend of Fuyao just to name a few.. maybe a little skeptical with their age gap.. but the beginning was really cute and entertaining.. but come on!  I'm on episode 31 and there were no character development to any of them.  He was still trusting the same evil people around him.  Kesong didn't even tell him about the pills but instead went directly to that unenthical doctor who should already lose his license that's so in love with that obsessive Ex.  Uugghh.. The stupid Canadian that I don't even know why he's in love with the evil cousin... who has an evil mentor that was Ethan's Ex-friend/partner.. or whatever he is..  Episode 31 and nothing happening about their love story.. oh come on already.  Cupid????
"ho guardato qualche puntata in inglese, mi sembra bello, ma ovviamente  scriverei anch'io una recensione completa se potessi leggere i sottotitoli in italiano.... grazie"
The ending was different.  Tried to minimize the romantic side of the movie  and that¡¯s understand able. Love the story. Love the actors.  Watched from beginning to the end in 3 days.
"I like the male and female lead and the cooking shows; however, I cannot give 10 for this drama because other characters are terrible and their motives are not very convincing.  There are lots of problems with this society.  Too many villains:  Elise, the doctor, Yilan, his mom, Elise's mom, Boris and his apprentice...  30 episodes and the ML still kind of dumb, still trust the wrong people."
"This show is just the best in all ways. Great soundtrack! I love the actors! The pacing of the story is just right. Kudos to all cast, crew and above the line people. Great direction!"
I like the chemistry among the cast but there are certainly a couple of actresses that are annoying and their dialogues aren¡¯t quite good. The last two chapters weren¡¯t my thing.
"Good drama. Great chemistry between the protagonist, will loved to see more romances but overall the show was well balanced and the actors performance were good especially the leads."
"The stars are for the main couple¡¯s amazing chemistry, the showcasing of the culinary arts, acting by the main couple (and a few others), and the production value.  Lin Ke Song has been friendzoned by Song Yi Ran, her best friend of over 10 years.  After losing her job, she decides to follow him to Shanghai.  Even though this drama is a romance between Jiang Qian Fan and Lin Ke Song, another arc is the personal growth experienced by these two best friends: one wanting first to become someone worthy of her crush, and the other motivated to be better after seeing his best friend¡¯s dedication and growth.  I appreciate how the romance between Qian Fan and Ke Song is handled: a slow progression from respect, trust, friendship to romantic love.  Since he¡¯s much older and more worldly than her, the pacing of their romance is just right and this allows for Ke Song to mature not only as a person but also grow her culinary skills.  What¡¯s a 40-episode drama without a lot of drama and villains? This has plenty of quite obnoxious characters, but that is what makes a drama worthy of watching since these terrible characters act as foils to the heroes/heroines of the story.  Although I feel that the ending was shortened/rushed and the bad guys not punished enough (does that say something about me personally?), I think I can understand that the writers aim for this drama to be about healing, forgiveness, and learning to move on.  I will definitely re-watch all the heart fluttering and warm scenes between Qian Fan and Ke Song, and maybe the food scenes, too.  Warning: do not watch on an empty stomach!"
"I¡¯m truly struggling with how to rate this show. I literally read other reviews before writing my opinion. 

I¡¯m a Diehard Ethan F??N! I do like the FL
I would not have a problem w/Older ML & younger FL. But I had a problem w/calling this romance w/NO ROMANCE. Those that have followed Ethan¡¯s many shows know how chemistry & acting skills. You could literally see him holding back. 

Don¡¯t select an actor/actress if they are not prepared to play the part as expected. 

I, like many other viewers was excited at the beginning of this show. But it like many other shows went off track. Fans don¡¯t like seeing bad people not get punished for doing extremely bad things. 

It also gives a bad impression that the culture approves of these types of behaviors. Wrong is wrong. If the person serves their time & can show true redemption then forgiveness can be given. 

I¡¯m not happy with the ending. Not 
because of dancing. They started off (for whatever reason) w/dance number, so I get it. But it seemed to be a distraction again for lack of romance. 

Most of the side stories was a complete waste of time. I fast forwarded most of them."
"Absolutely loved this romantic drama! The food alone was amazing. Enjoyed the storyline and all the actor relationships! Would have loved to have seen
an engagement or wedding."
The scriptwriters must have called in sick around episode 38.  I guess the choreographer helped out!  The chemistry between the two main leads overcame shortcomings in the script.
"I am having a hard time with this show, the food parts are great but these female characters are ANNOYING.    I forgot why I stopped watching Cdramas but am remembering. the lack of strong female characters.
What is with Elise's character? How many more episodes of Kesong being whiny and her cousin I just want to shake. 
 I am trying to stick with this one because I do enjoy Ethan but it's not holding my attention."
Sinceramente me mantuvo atrapada y me gusto. Hubiera preferido un final m¨¢s interesante evitando el musical que pusieron ya que en mi opini¨®n le quito seriedad y sentimiento .
"There are so many  things to say about this amazing drama. My first draw was Ethan Juan...it's been awhile since we have seen him. He just keeps getting better as an actor and more handsome as the years go by. Our FL, Song  Zu Er, was a perfect cast as his student. She is spunky and cute and incredibly smart. Together, they make their characters come alive with an over the top chemistry, despite the age difference. 
This is a story of love. All kinds of love...and what can happen in people's lives when they learn what it really means to care for themselves, their families, chosen professions and most of all, the person who is in their hearts. It is a story of jealousy and pride and how destructive they can be when they are allowed to grow inside the soul. It is also a story of forgiveness and how healing it can be for everyone. The setting in the world and art of food is shown with great beauty from the opening to the end credits. The music was perfect for them both. There was some frustration for me with the really awful/evil characters who seemed to get away with their terrible deeds for so long, which happens a lot in Chinese dramas. All in all, this drama is a must watch if you like Ethan and food."
"Kind of sappy, but still worth watching.  Chinese dramas (in my opinion) aren¡¯t as good as Korean dramas, but they do spend money to make them lavish, if that means anything."
"El final ni al caso, y no tienen subt¨ªtulos en espa?ol a apartir del episodio 5, pero me gustaron las tomas de las comidas... al drama m¨¢s o menos, y malditos los villanos"
The 2  leads had amazing chemistry! This is now one of my top 5 most favorite Chinese dramas. I kept waiting for Elize to get to what was coming to her and to be honest was kind of let down (and don't vet me started on the way the doc turned on his patient for her). I'm annoyed I never found out what happened with his assistant And I still don't understand the last 2 minutes.. But otherwise this was absolutely amazing and I loved it!!! I wish I could give it more than 10 stars. Also I loved the soundtrack and will be looking for some of the songs later.
Beginning was fun and promising¡­ now I¡¯m waiting for ep 39 and 40 to be posted with subtitles on YT (I¡¯m paying for Viki not YT but that¡¯s a different topic¡­.) just so I can see how it ends. Around midway I started to skip most of the scenes. Some of the most annoying characters I¡¯ve ever seen.. no comment about the acting (ahem Elise) because this whole review would just turn out to be one massive rant. And what I really really hate is the FL¡¯s voice¡­ don¡¯t know if it¡¯s dubbed or not but she sounds (and behaves) like a 15 year old girl... And don¡¯t get me started about the writing.
"Un doce de romance,??????????nos faz sentir todas as emo??es, raiva ¨®dio, amor, tristeza, tudo , ????????????????"
"Pas mal. Mais la fin est insatisfaisante pour moi.
Tr¨¨s beau beau jeu d¡¯acteurs. Heureuse de revoir Ethan Juan apr¨¨s Fuyao . Faire un effort sur les doublages."
"Very good I did enjoy  the drama, but next time let the evil  do their time and must be punished, getting them off is sending a wrong message to society. Thank you."
"Loved the food scenes and lead actors, story was uneven, spending lots of developing story time and little resolution time.  Did not get the Bollywood type ending."
"Similar to the food in this show, I enjoyed eating it and then it went through and out, never to be seen again. I wanted this show to be better than it was. I started watching because I like the two main actors, and continued watching because I thought the story was interesting. 
It started off strong - I liked the FL, her personality grew on me, and Ethan is such a great actor. Sadly, this drama became one of those that didn't know what it was supposed to be.  It's not an intense romance, or even immersive. At times I forgot there was supposed to be romance. The story had a good premise and promise, but it turned weird and unbelievable.  I thought this story would be more sophisticated and clever, and thought it would delve deeper into the issues. Thankfully the supporting cast and their stories held the show up. I enjoyed them all, even Xiayou had a relatable back story, and even Boris turned out well at the end. There's a scene where ML tells his ex he is going to get back with her - and then a following episode  he is with the new love interest - and no confrontation with the ex about this?  it's so weird and fragmented.
I also can't condone some of the awful behaviour of the ML. ( I don't find these things romantic and actually a turn off) The treatment of a loyal housekeeper, the explosive rage, the locking up, the starvation techniques, the confiscation of the phone.

BUT so many criminal acts that never had any visible consequences - that turned me off so much.  Actually, I think there was 1-2 episodes at the end that were not aired - parts of the end story seemed to be just 'not there' I thought I missed some episodes. In other words, THERE WAS NO CONFRONTATION between the protagonists and the antagonists - no conclusion between the Doc and Elise and with Ollie and what they did to him. No words spoken, no thoughts even shared regarding his feelings on the matter.  except some voiced over narrative from the FL.  It was the worse let down."
Foi linda hist¨®ria  mais tinha que ter mais paix?o entre os dois.o final foi um pouco fraco.. est?o de parab¨¦ns  os atores.
"I have never been so disappointed in a drama as much as I am in this one. The writers are HORRIBLE! The only reason I wanted to see this drama is because of Ethan but his character is angry and naive.  Keesong continues to get stepped on by EVERYBODY and she accepts it. And continues to make excuses for her evil hearted cousin.  She NEVER have any heart to heart talks w/ Oliver about important things but when she discovers something new that may help with his taste problems who does she call,, the Doctor not Oliver.. seriously?  Not too mention, you have the Doctor covering up for Elise...and helping her w/ the blackmailer...WOW! I have never seen so many evil hearted women/men in one drama.  Oh let's not forget Blu...talk about naive. The cousin have an evil heart and she's so rude &  disrespectful but he refuses to see it. A tiger never changes its stripes. And is this a romance drama? Because where is the romance? Ok, I'm done for now because I watch it on YouTube and I've seen more episodes, so I will wait to comment more once this mess is over with."
"Lie, cheat steal. The person this chef trusted the most poisoned him and he lost his sense of taste because he ended their boyfriend/girlfriend relationship."
"this is an extremely feel good series. there is next to none on romance but, good on  honor, respect and understanding from the female lead towards the male lead as he goes through trials and tribulations in his personal and professional life.

extremely disappointed with viki team as being a paid plus member, for not providing English subtitles, for this series in timely manner. had to watch the rest of episodes from 28 onwards on some other online site.

fallen in love with another of Song Zu Er's series , other was: fly with you ,  where she was a speed ice skater.

here she is shown as a foodie has an ambition of becoming a Chef but never was given an ounce of a chance, what she has  are gifted taste buds. she can distinguish any and all spices and ingredients in food and drinks. the male lead who is an English return master chef,   on recognizing her talent at a food tasting event quickly takes her under his wing despite she losing the first competition she enters and becomes nations laughing stock.

competition in 38th episode is touching. glad they shot it that way. it brings home an important message to young adults.

the other interesting character was Boris, who is shown here as an under dog and overly competitive. He hates male lead to the bone,  hate is as far as pressing his buttons towards the culinary preparations and competitions. he does not do him any bodily harm. Boris kept the series interesting till 38th episode.

Other actors played their part. Elise is true villain in this series. there is a saying , you never know who will stab you when the stakes are high  especially from those who are closest to you. and take for granted.

the last episode 40th, was disappointing in my opinion. they show happy ending,  where the lead recover from non clinical trial medicine. he was supposed to die from complete nervous break down but magically is saved an fully recovered. in my opinion an alternate ending would have been better where there is sadness and remorse but also promising, like the male lead dies, the guilty elise and doctor gets punished and the female lead goes to Paris for studies returns back as legend master chef with male leads grown make  baby in 5 years with male leads name. in my opinion it would have been a good ending. just throwing it out there  for find sake .

this series is written and shot sensibly.

i do not like many Chinese modern era dramas but this is an exception, here kdramas are gooood,   but their Chinese historical drama are extremely good. here historical kdramas sucks.

must watch series in my opinion, a kind of rags to riches story or a modern day Cinderella story . 

it's fun to watch, give it a try 

"
"Thoroughly enjoyed this series!  The actors, the story, all of it.  Couldn¡¯t stop watching!  Thank you for hours of good entertainment ??"
Entertaining esp if you like food. The ending was a little forced but most episodes were fun. A bit more sophisticated than your average C-drama rom com.
Excelente serie!!! Me encant¨® como presentan la comida con ese amor y la utilizan para expresar los sentimientos de cada uno de los actores y actrices.
dont get the dancing at the end. no connection to the storyline at all! preferr if they spent the few minutes showing the characters living their lives.
"This show was really good. At first i thought it was going to be another dating in the kitchen esp when i saw the big age difference btwn the ML and FL. But as i continued watching i realized this had it¡¯s own unique story. I also thought they were going to kill the ML coming closer to the end and im glad they didnt. The ending was a bit over the top with the flash mob number plus every time the FL broke into song was a bit weird. But the part i couldn¡¯t get over is how the ex-GF and the doc pretty much got away with almost killing this man. That part of the story made me really upset. Other than that the cooking competition was great. I really loved the FL in this and her previous drama. The ML was great too. Awesome chemistry btwn the 2, very believable to the point where i didn¡¯t mind the age difference and was actually rooting for them. Nice work "
"I really liked this drama. Great acting, good story line, kept my attention at all times.
Thank you everyone for your hard work. It's a ten in my book."
lamento no poder seguir viendo esta comedia ya que se indico que estaria en espa?ol pero ya ase 3 semaNAS QUE NO EXISTE EL ESPA?OL EN ESTA  COMEDIA
Loved this drama!!! Story line stayed in sinc and not many low spots. One problem was all the food looked so good it made me hungry watching!
"Simply Beautiful ??????????????

A special thank you to the people translating into other languages for us to enjoy "
"Hola, me gusto mucho, pero mi ingl¨¦s no es tan bueno, por favor traducir los subt¨ªtulos en espa?ol , me encantar¨ªa seguir disfrutando ?????????????? me encanta el tema y los actores"
"Overall a good show to watch. The two lead actors are very good. However, there are quite a few ridiculous situations and  characters in the story."
"Me gust¨® mucho la historia, la fotograf¨ªa de la comida es magn¨ªfica  aunque hubo poco romance, la pareja es muy tierna, sobretodo ella."
Great drama even though it took a long time for the subtitles. Thanks to all the actors and behind the set .and all that made this drama great.
"This drama is honestly a waste of time, there are better dramas out there with very similar story lines. If you¡¯re looking for a similar drama I would recommend ¡®The Perfect Match¡¯. It¡¯s 2022 and there are unfortunately still dramas like this being produced. This type of drama content may have been popular in the early 10s when rich jerk of a male lead who is arrogant and very dubious and stupidly dumb doormat of a female fall in love. Then there is the second male leads who are usually oblivious and annoying but turn out okay at some point. Then we have the evil step sister of a second female lead who goes to great lengths to ruin the male lead and female lead at all costs because she can¡¯t have the male lead so no one else can. The fact that they never get punished either and someone who was coerced into doing one or two things that weren¡¯t even bad end up having harsher punishments than someone who made someone else lose their taste and go blind is insane. Let¡¯s not even begin to talk about the horrible dubbing"
Thank you so much love it ??????????????????????????????????????
"I loved this drama! I am a caterer and desserts are my speciality. But the dishes and desserts in this drama gave me inspiration! Loved it!,"
The 8 stars is for the food and education. Bit hard to like the temperamental attitude of ml character and fl appeared far too young for ml
"Me encantan las series coreanas, pero fuera m¨¢s fascinante si las colocar¨¢n con la opci¨®n en espa?ol por favor "
Lovely theme and plenty of drama . I would have preferred all the bad guys to get their just desserts though (Pun Intended) at the end¡­.
"Alright, absolutely adored this drama, the leads, the story, overall a 10. But I¡¯m deducting 1 for the crazy dance and not enough "
Love the food porn and looking forward to subtitles appearing in a timely manner. Just finished Sword Snow Stride and appreciated the subtitles already in place as episodes appeared each day. Thanks to the translators!
Ainda ¨¦ um pouco inst¨¢vel. N?o consigo ver onde est¨¢ os meus favoritos. Estou testando antes de uma poss¨ªvel sa¨ªda da Netflix
"I was excited to watch this drama because of Ethan Juan since I do not know the other actors/actresses. Unfortunately this fell short as a romantic comedy and  for a drama. I agree with many others that 40 episodes is too long especially with a rushed ending to wrap each pair together. 

The story line was unrealistic. I¡¯m not sure how one can ¡°take taste away¡± via diffusing an essential oil. The mysterious supplier was never revealed or resolved in the drama either. There may have been several antagonistic characters but there was moral at the end¡­Mrs. Quentin wanting to protect her children, the doctor wanting to protect Elise, etc etc¡­While they didn¡¯t add too much to the drama it didn¡¯t bother me as much as the plot between the ML and FL. I thought they had great chemistry. There were some sweet scenes but would¡¯ve liked more development of them as a couple. At the very least, the FL should have been portrayed as completing culinary school and able to stand alone as a chef. 

The sugar theme, however was handled well. It started with the ML losing taste for sweetness and then regaining his taste for sweet. A sugarless restaurant to ending with a dessert party. The musical like ending didn¡¯t bother me too much as it seemed fitting. "
"I saw the drama out of translation no English, I try to saw it again with translation! But I like it very much ??????"
"The novel which it's based on is way better and they should've stayed true to it, but the drama makes up for it with the main couple's extremely good chemistry and dynamic I wish they hadn't changed the male character's disability from the novel as it would've made the drama way better than it is. The biggest flaw with this is how slow the subbing is I'm so impatient so I end up watching the episodes raw and rewatch when the subs come."
"Nice story line. Too much food. And not enough acting  Enjoyed the actors, they were each in character and not over the top!"
"Really enjoyed the show for the most part. Great if you like food shows as well. A bit slow at times, but overall, entertaining."
Love the series I didn¡¯t know much about food until now makes wanna go to china and explore cultural and food . 100% recommend
"Loved the food. Loved the actors. I have Not been disappointed in any of Ethan's roles.  SZE, I think she is a great actress.  The storyline was good, had a few annoying holes. I was able to push past them. Really got into it in episode 11. Then the last 6 episodes, so rushed and made no sense. If going to wrap it up in bow just leave kill it after the end of the competition. It made me so upset and disappointed. 
Aside from. LX getting burned no one paid for their wrong doings. Are you kidding me?! 
Oh wait Li Yan paid for his being forced to go and get the infusing oils.   He is the only one I had sympathy for.
Elise apparently a few months in jail and SQ forgave her. I call BS. She gets to go live in Europe, somewhere. 
Junjin, did not have his medical practice etc called into question. Also forgiven. 
SQ goes looses his taste and site media all over him and Luxia restaurant, like flies on crap. Elise literally poisons someone to ruin their life and the Q company not affected at all. 
I did love the Chu Ting and Sang Yi Ran story. I think they need a drama together themselves. "
"I just love this romantic  drama. The main cast very charismatic, they did avoid job ohhh and the dancers a the end lovely "
"A wonderful drama with strong narrative, excellent leads and actors, and the sumptuous food porn. I will be watching it again."
"Love it! just not crazy about the musical extra ending.

Can someone tell me who sings the song at the end of each episodes !"
"I bet disappointed for this drama it¡¯s a lot hang and not solve the problem and the end is to rush,but overall still good."
Estoy  muy  interesada en esta serie os a gradeceria que  por favor la pudieras traducir pronto  en espa?ol muchas gracias
"I was hooked on this show from the beginning! I really enjoyed watching this, definitely will be rewatching in the future!"
"Very nice story, terrible ending.  It has nothing to do with the style the series carried out throughout the entire thing."
"I will admit, I grew a bit impatient waiting for the shows to be added so I did find the rest of the serious somewhere else. I did enjoy watching the show. The food looked delicious. I will say though, some of the characters kind of annoyed me and there were times where I skipped scenes due to those characters. The ML and FL made me keep going back to it. I will say though, the last episode, I'm just not sure how I feel about it. I would love to see the leads in another show together."

"a culinary drama that will not remain unforgettable
First I watched this drama for Ethan, who I really like, and he did a great job, as usual.

I enjoy food dramas, but there are so many scenes on food (including a regular chorus on street food that makes you wonder what it's doing in the drama) that we have a bellypain!

Regarding the story, the plot of the chef who loses his sense of taste is a classic in culinary dramas.
It's well done and the first episodes are catchy.

But we get lost very quickly in a multitude of additional characters, parallel stories, useless scenes, which leads to a very slow and quickly boring narration.

The CL's relationship develops slowly, very slowly, first from chef to apprentice, then lovers. But OTPs are too rare. The romance isn't enough seen on the screen. The focus is really on cooking and competitions.
The ""villain"" character is quite coherent, but I don't really understand her ""accomplices"" (doctor/lover and brother). How can they let her sink into her obsession like this?

The OSTs are good (even if the occasional singers obviously sing other lyrics :).
But I admit that I don't understand (and don't like) the ""Bolywood"" final at all."
La am¨¦ ????????????????????????????????????
If I can¡¯t wait for the next episode then it is good!  I couldn¡¯t wait!  Thank you so much! Simply delicious??
"Una bella historia de amor con un final feliz para todos, sin excepci¨®n. Una oda al amor, incluido el amor familar."
Genial  me encanta  muy buena serie  felicidades a todos los que hacen posible todo ese maravilloso trabajo
"Spoiler. They get together in the end. I felt like it was a good show, but had A LOT of unnecessary stuff mixed in."
Actually nice to have a straight simple story I believe it is a romance with good actors It is shame that the ratings are low because of the slow subtitles which are making them slower but don't go on them they are unfair give the drama a chance and I wish people would stop giving stars based on translation speed but the actual story
"Um pouco longo mas, o enredo ¨¦ agrad¨¢vel. Cale assistir para ver os lindos pratos preparados por chefs chineses."
I thought this was a really good drama. The cast were excellent. They could done without the musical at the end.
Went to bed at three thirty binge watching the last twenty episodes of this drama. Overall enjoyed the build up of the story I feel it could have been told in 24 episodes without the drag out at the end of the culprit finally being revealed and  not getting the consequences I had hoped for. The leads had great chemistry and are good actors.  Loved the musical ending reminds me overall of Wok of Love similar cooking storyline with great food made me hungry to watch.
Cute in the beginning kept my attention ending left a lot to be desired acting was not the best but did the job
"Better than I expected.  Actual plot, characters,acting.  Foreign actors were stereotypes. Amazing food scenes."
I have never been more annoyed and frustrated with a drama than I was with this one. For one the antagonist didn't get what was due to her because she did so many bad things and they just let it go. The female lead and the male lead didn't have too much chemistry but it wasn't terrible. The female lead was really good The male lead was okay and that poor man kept getting all kinds of poo thrown at him I felt so bad. It was not my favorite but I had to see how it ended and there are way too many episodes. It dragged on for way too long. Had way too many story lines. Just annoying.
"I absolutely loved this show!!!!! It really displays the passion and love for food and cooking! It made me respect chefs even more! The visuals of the food and the cooking were fantastic and I loved the themesong especially but the other music as well. Loved the ML&FL, great chemistry. she is such a great actress, loved her in Flying with you and here again, I guess she can be paired with anyone and do a super job! Little points of critique¡­ after all the great episodes and enjoying the storyline that was way better than most of the Chinese shows, I kind of felt the last episode was a little messy¡­there were so many nice things to say in the end, all the little stories to be  wrapped up and that could¡¯ve been done with more debt and feeling¡­ the recovery was to easy to my taste¡­ Elise"
"I wanted to give it more stars but the only reason I continued watching it was for the two main leads. Usually it's guessable when the two main leads will confess their feelings but this show threw me off. I didn't expect the show to be almost over before they were an official couple. Which was both nice and aggravating. I will admit that I found the episodes before they got together to be more intriguing because the flirting was here, there, and everywhere. I didn't like most of the characters at all which was saddening. I think out of the whole cast I only liked Qianfan, Kesong, Kesong's uncle, Blu, Blu's mentor, Thomas, Song Yiran, Chu Ting, K, and sometimes Boris just because he was so charismatic. I didn't like Victor until the end when he met K and I feel like he's always given the same roles where he's tofu on the inside but doesn't quite know how to express his feelings so he comes off harsh. I didn't understand why they had to make almost every character have a love story but I guess that's why they called it ""Cupid's Kitchen"". It was probably more dramatic than it needed to be and some of the scenes or even whole episodes could have been cut out. Also like most Chinese dramas, almost everything gets magically sorted out in the last couple of episodes no matter how much it doesn't make sense."
Very unique drama. Wonderful scenes of cooking food. Really inspired me to learn more about Asian/Chinese cooking. Ethan Juan was absolutely wonderful. I was a bit frustrated with the bad characters not getting what they deserved. Too much forgiveness but some wonderful life lessons. I have to admit the middle episodes dragged but the last few episodes really had my attention and were very emotional. Some may say the pairing of the two leads were odd but their relationship grew on me and became something very sweet to watch. There was a real depth to their love and the chemistry was most evident in the final few episodes. A tearjerker for me. This made the series worthwhile and memorable for me. I loved the dancing and fun ending. Loved how all the couples came together. Sweet drama with silly moments. Made me hungry!
"I finally watched all of it but, I never really stopped yelling at the screen.  Like others have mentioned, too many people get away with what they did/are.  I would have to give this over to bad writing.  I think I am finished with Chinese dramas.  Their society is so sheltered and controlled they just don't have a grasp on so much of life and when it comes to writing these shows/dramas - it is very clear that they guess their way through most of it.

Better than most Chinese dramas.  They did spend lots of money on this one and use it wisely.  We get a major education on food and how it is so different depending on where you are from (villages/provinces).  

I still feel this could have been so much shorter.  So much wasted time with stuff that didn't have anything to do with the rest of anyone's story.  The dubbing and such is so bad that one character has the amazing ability to sound like someone else each time he sings.  It's a bit unnerving.  When that type of scene would start, I would skip past it.  LOL  

While some dramas have made the food another character, this one keeps food as a backdrop.  It is discussed as if it is important to everyone but, while we do learn many things as the too many episodes plod along - we just watch people cut, prep, cook and eat while they go through the motions.  We learn the most through Ethan.

I agree with some of the other reviews that this story has too many bad people getting away with what they've done.  I figured out the main evil person (who cares why she is doing it) so early that I've grown frustrated with the constant revelations and them dragging everything out.  Why do so many people end up getting hit by buses, trucks, and cars in K-Dramas but, Elise can't wander into a busy street in this one?

Love the main characters and a couple of the side stories.  This was clearly made to be a travelogue type story.  Get people interested in visiting the area and trying all the different kinds of food.  It takes time to get used to Song Zu Er - she can be quite annoying and immature - her growth takes much longer than traditional Asian dramas - she seems to backslide into the childish realm a bit too often - petty.

I'll stick with it but, I am starting to fast forward through the time filler stuff so, I can focus on the main stories.  There is enough there to keep you interested but, know you will get frustrated and might start throwing things at your screen."
"I was really looking forward to this drama, but it rapidly turned into a DNF. The FL and ML didn¡¯t work as a couple for me , the side characters were annoying, and I rapidly lost interest despite the food porn and the promise of a cooking competition. What a disappointment after loving Song Zuer in To Fly with You.  I ¡®m glad others found it more palatable (hah!), because I love culinary dramas and would like to see more of them."
I loved the food in this show. I feel like it was the real show and the people were just the background.
"This was just an overall bad show in so many ways.  It got three stars, two for the food aspect and one for Ethan Ruan.  That is it.  The storyline and writing were horrible.  The female lead was awful.  She looked and acted like a 15 year old and it was not plausible that the male lead would ever go for someone as childish and immature. Way to Svengalish for my taste.  Really gave me the creeps.  I understand Older man/young female is as old as time but this was not believable.  The side characters were all just dismal and evil.  What message did this show carry?  Lie, lie again, physically harm someone, keep on lying and guess what?  You will get away with it.  For the life of me I can not understand why Ethan would sign on for such nonsense."
Otimo! Ethan Juan ¨¦ lindo. E talentoso. Os pratos parecem muito apetitosos e me deram ¨¢gua na boca.
"I enjoyed the idea of the plot and the cast was well chosen. That being said there are several points in the show that had me very aggravated, such as when leading lady was being locked in the car and used a wrench to break window when she could of just manually unlocked the car she did not need the fob.  The doctor¡¯s role also left me aggravated. Patient confidentiality is important and he broke it at every point not to mention aiding and abiding a criminal.  

All in all I liked the male and female leads story arc and would watch these two again."
"Major spoiler included, read at your own risk.

But holy moly, Elise is evil! And watching her cry her way thru nearly all episodes over what she'd done to Oli but not actually turning herself in until the final episode really grated on me. For that reason, I couldn't love this show. It even made me hate a bit."
"I don't normally do reviews, but this show was just not as cute and romantic as the summary says it is.  It was pretty depressing at times.  It was cute at times too, but the darkness of the show overwhelmed the romantic comedy I thought this show was suppose to be about.  I really kept thinking, the bad guys will eventually be caught, but the punishment for each one was disappointing or non existent.  And that's why I rated it so low.  Cheaters got away with cheating.  People who caused the most damage, also had a semi happy ending.  

The cooking part was nice.  Made me want to eat during and after each episode.  I only read some of the reviews after watching episode 34,  hoping justice occurs, but after reading the spoilers and knowing it doesn't, that was annoying.  If it wasn't for the last episode, I would of rated this show a 2 star."
Ethan Juan never disappointed me.I could understand why they choose young FL. The ending should have been better  otherwise I like it.????????????
"I don¡¯t know how this will end, but I find I am not waiting till an episode is translated into English to watch the next one, and then I go back the first time I have available to rewatch it once it has been translated. 30 episodes in and I am thinking I want to go back to the beginning to rewatch. Really enjoyable drama so far, I love cooking and the food imagery, the hope filled wanna be, the passion filled educated chef who needs to learn to temper himself better-  is just - visually fun and entertaining. The characters do a good job of making this drama emotionally moving. I like that I am feeling the themes of possible redemption in more than one story line."
Traduzione in italiano o spagnolo perch¨¦ ¨¨ bella
"I really really liked that Drama. It has cost me the last four nights and every day I really was looking forward to finish my daily work just to return to Song Zu Er and Ethan Juan. Their chemistry was so unbelievable sweet, adorable and so not straight forward. Normally I don't watch Dramas with so many episodes, because at one point it is getting so boring and predictable and the ""tigress"" gets on my nerves, but this time I appreciate that the Maker took their time to establish all characters to their full potential. 

In every Intro you see a lot of scenes you are quite excited to see them finally happen, but in this intro you can just see food. And every Episode I was so excited to see which one from the Intro will be now created. It was amazing. I will watch this show again. 

The only Warning I can give not to watch it if you are really hungry!!!!!!  It is cruel!"
"The build up into a relationship, was fantastic.  So glade they didn¡¯t ruin it in the end!"
I didn¡¯t mind the little silly scene at the end.  It looked like everyone was having fun.
"Cupid's Kitchen-  So I really liked this drama.  Loved the food cuisine aspect of the story.  I myself am in an artistic field, but one of my first mentors a long time ago introduced me to movies with food themes and this opened me to a greater appreciation of this genre.   I was also lucky that my career gave me the opportunity  to travel to China and discover this incredible culture and its wide range of foods.  Shanghai is one of my favorite cities.

I loved the mentor relationship in the storyline for the various actor's and really thought they all did an excellent  job.  The female lead played by Song Zuer, continues to impress me.  This is the 2nd drama I have seen her in.    Ethan Juan, the male lead was new to me, but  I really liked him in this role.

My only real complaint about the series is that the scenes where they sang in english were really off.   They really need to work on this."
"I really liked this drama. The male lead was a terrific actor. Female lead was really cute and bubbly, and there was a nice amount of chemistry between them. This has a ton of cooking fancy dishes, which I enjoy. Could of had a few more kisses. But I¡¯m giving this a nine because it was really good, and I certainly didn¡¯t get bored."
Food scenes from. Street vendors was good. Great Cast women where great. Siblings rivalry.
Need to more language I¡¯m read English but I¡¯m not understand very well Spanish please
"Currently loving this right now from one fellow chef who also works in a Michelin star restaurant 
Know that I've finished this, What was that ending?! How the hell did junbin not get his medical license revoked?? Don't even get me started on Elise, what she did was unforgivable, after everything she did to him she didn't even have the guts to apologise to him!!  
Elise showed no remorse for any of her actions and then you have that stupid doctor still treating him knowing that he covered up Elise's crimes!! That was such an unrealistic ending in today's society. Seriously what was with that music video ending. Just weird."
"I really like this drama, except when the ML is giving punishments to the FL.  I also like the FL actress. I've seen several of her dramas and she's good. (A big thanks to the subbers for being so quick to have the subtitles ready on this one!)"
"The storyline started out promising but there were just too many things that caused me to not like it as much as I¡¯d like to have liked it. I didn¡¯t like how there was so much anger and hate from the side characters and then in the end it wasn¡¯t resolve properly to me it was just resolved. I didn¡¯t like how the story ended it just seemed rushed and not thought out. I don¡¯t know, I don¡¯t recommend and I¡¯m sad because I love the actors."
"Excelente serie, la producci¨®n con las im¨¢genes de comida son maravillosas. Ethan Ruan es un muy buen actor. Ella logro tener mucha qu¨ªmica con ¨¦l. Relaci¨®n cocinada a fuego lento. No quiero dar spoilers, solo dire que todos los amantes de la comida china, sentir¨¢n que esta serie es porno gastron¨®mico, jajajaja, de verdad quede con ganas de cocinar, aprender, ir a China a comer. La recomiendo en verdad"
Muy buena la recomiendo es una novela que la estoy comenzando a ver y ya me gust¨® mucho
This show ranks second highest of all the show I have seen .it is definitely a must see.
"Not done watching yet -I'm at Episode 27 now(the number of stars may or may not change as we move forward. But I have a comment about the FL. She's been studying under a Michelin rated, ""top notch ""chef for months, but during the competition she is still very clumsy, facial expression, movements are still that of an un experienced girl who knows nothing about cooking. It's becoming annoying. She could at least (pretend), show  some improvement in her handling of the knife-cutting, slicing ot the ingredients for the show. And they don't focus on what the contestant is making individually. And the end product of the FL is not what they're practicing about. Far from it. I think the writer or the the director of this drama is at fault. I have seen several other dramas abt cooking competitions  but are much better presented. And is the ML that stupid to be deceived(many times) by that restaurant partner of his. Poisoned to keep him by her side. What a load of ....! And after several episodes she's still living like nothing has happened.   Not sure how many more episodes to go or if I can tolerate more of this stupidness going on."
"This series started out strong and promising.  Super cute M & F lead that were easy to watch and root for.  Unfortunately the M lead doesn¡¯t have growth in his character development.  He is impetuous, temperamental, a typical man child, he can¡¯t even protect his business and is so easily manipulated it is hard to have any respect for him.  The way they developed  his relationship with the 2nd F lead is bizarre.  Not because she is off the chart psycho but because they have stopped any romantic attraction between him and the F lead.  The immature 2nd M lead matured so much and looking much more attractive than the M lead.  Finished this series (on youtube) it was not satisfying.  I rewatch many series that I love but I will never watch this one again.  Did not even hold a candle to Dating in the Kitchen.  That series was sexy, and the food made by lead FL looked amazing.  10 stars to Dating in the Kitchen."
The story was cute and interesting. The girl does become a chef and I like the ending.
I wanted punishment bc f them evil turds. I¡¯m disappointed by their forgiveness 
The story was cute and interesting. The girl does become a chef and I like the ending.
This was great series loved it ¡­ actors were awesome I will watch it again 
"Love it!
Hoping for a second season!! Great chemistry between the two main characters"
"Chemistry was great between characters. It was entertaining in spots. However, there were too many episodes that dragged the story line down. Once again we have a Female lead who is portrayed as weak and silly and needs to be bullied into becoming an adult. There were too many scenes where the characters had unrealistic reactions."
"Loved the story at first , but now at 24 episodes  two things bug me: 
1-  the second FL has clearly psychological problems and needs help but her mother (who seems intelligent) and her friend doctor ( who should know that she needs help) keep quiet on her poisionning incidents. And what¡¯s more the doctor is also friend with ML. I can only see bad results from this stupid silence. 
Another thing the ML suspected everyone but the second FL even if she was clingy and didn¡¯t accept the breakup. 
I love the FL developpement. And that of  the second ML. I will continue watching in hope that some good sense gets into the characters. 
"
I think it was a fenomenal drama sweet tasty loving sad but happiness at the ending
"Only watched bc fan of the main actor. What's up with dubbing over the singing. Was that really their voice because I can't imagine, haha. If it wasn't for the bad choice songs  or singing, I would give it higher rating. The ending felt rushed...I mean come on...40 episode and then they decide to call it a wrap. Sad, was expecting something better if you're going to make 40 episodes with that kind of ending... Could've ended at 30 or 20 if ""that's it."" I would recommend watching this as a filler to pass time as you wait for your other dramas to upload."
"Cute show! A quick watch and the leads have excellent chemistry, and lots of food!"
"Beaucoup de mauvaise critiques sont bas¨¦es sur la m¨¦chancet¨¦ des personnages  et c'est vrai, comment ce script peut r¨¦unir autant de gens si stupides !, LA FL en premier qui quand elle est attaqu¨¦ ne dit que des banalit¨¦ le ML qui est carr¨¦ment d¨¦bile  et alors le reste on en parle m¨ºme pas
Si vous aimez le style FL carpette ML matcho alors c'est OK moi c'est pas mon truc...."
I love this drama. A few of the episodes wasn't what I expected. But still loved.
Translation  very slow. Series has completed translation  0% for last 4 episodes.
Excellent beginning and ending although i wish the subtitles came through faster.
"Cupids Kitchen this is not. They should have named this Obsession and Jealousy in the Kitchen. There are so many evil people and side stories in this drama that it overshadows the plot and the plot is eventually loss. 

Two reasons to watch this¡­
1. Ethan Yuan. The saving grace of this drama. I finished this drama solely because of Ethan. He did a good job with what he had to work with and you can¡¯t deny he is a handsome man who is easy on the eyes
2. Watch this if you want to see lots of evil over the top comical characters in a ridiculous plot

Spoiler Alert: The ML going blind towards the last few chapters was unnecessary and added to the ridiculousness of the entire drama

I have no issues with the short musical at the end of the final chapter. I wish the entire drama had leaned towards the cheerful and positive vibe proposed at the end"
"This is a wonderful ,fun & uplifting drama, with the most   Harming lead actors!"
"The story covers the importance of family, the value of hard work,  loyalty, & unconditional love.  I love the chemistry of Lin Ke Song and Jiang Qian Fan and I appreciated the fact that there was a lot of emphasis on their storyline.  I watched Song Zu Er in other roles and I just really enjoy watching her.  It's my first time to watch Ethan Juan and I'm not disappointed.  He played the role really well and I would like to watch him again in another drama.  I watched all 40 episodes in one sitting. I have it on my watchlist to watch over again.   I highly recommend."
"Story was good. As for ending, not sure if the dancing made sense to the story."
From the actors to learning about food I love everything about it 
The dubbing was so off other than that it was alright. Loved with Ethan Ruan!!
I enjoy watching this show. I like the chemistry between the lead characters.
"I legitimately have no idea how this is rated so high, unless everyone who rated it didn't finish the last 20 or so episodes. When the show was focused on cooking it was really good, but the ridiculous stuff that ML was going through between losing his sense of taste and then going freaking blind, and the other side character nonsense that was going on, it is really terrible. I think when it was focused on cooking I was distracted by the beautiful food shots because I'm a big fan of food porn, but once we didn't have that anymore I had to focus on the actual writing and what was happening more, and I was miserable watching this. On top of that the age gap was much larger than I would typically watch. Dude is old enough to be her dad practically. 

 I typically would put something like this under a spoiler but I'm hoping that someone will read this and love themselves and not watch this show. God bless the subbers that actually finished this and gave us subs. Giving it a 5 out of 10 for the half of episodes that I enjoyed."
"The beauty of C-dramas for me is how they champion the idea that extraordinary beauty and achievement in life is the result of ordinary people dreaming big dreams and working hard to make them come true.  That is an important theme in Cupid's Kitchen, underscored by beautiful visuals and, in most cases, characters who are ordinary people who succeed because of big dreams and a lot of motivation.

I am not familiar with any of the actors except Ethan Juan. I applaud him for his willingness to become his character, a brilliant loner whose life is  falling apart.  I am not used to him looking quite so scruffy and anti-social (eew on the haircut), but he is quite believable in his role.

If I have any complaints, it is that some of the romances drag  on far too long in the ""I hate you"" stage and are a little cringe-worthy when the people involved finally realize they care about each other.

As for the subtitles, I am impressed with the amount of work represented in the English subtitles.  Chinese and English are very different languages with very different ways of expressing the same concepts.  I  have noticed a few  subs that are in good but not idiomatic English, but otherwise the subs have seemed very natural to me and have helped me to enjoy the show.

(And FWIW, people who don't like Viki's way of subbing, complaining that things done by volunteers are too slow and incomplete, should volunteer to learn subbing and help make the process better and faster.)"
"This started out great but fell short towards episode 4, it went downhill from there. Btw, the villainess¡¯ acting and dubbed scenes were horrible and painful to watch, she is the worst villain in dramaland. On the other hand, the second leads have no relevance to the story, just a total waste of screen time so I fast forwarded their scenes.  even the background music sucks..  don¡¯t waste your time here. Oh and by the way, where was Cupid when all of this crap was taking place? "
"From the beginning to the end of this drama I was looking forward to every new episode. The main leading actress was so entertaining from her facial expressions, funny gestures overall her acting was superb!! The main male actor was just as superb. The chemistry between them made for a real joy to watch. A must-see drama!!!!"
Para mi gusto fue demasiado drama y poco romance y un final un tanto raro.
I love this series and I¡¯ll watch all 40 episodes again  very good story
Para mi gusto fue demasiado drama y poco romance y un final un tanto raro.
"One of the worst ending dramas I¡¯ve ever watched. If you have the time to kill then watch this show by all means.  You have been warned. :)  The only reason I watched until the end was because of the food/cuisine featured here, although I can tell that this show is trying to subtly promote their food culture. The male and female lead artists were good, the reason for the one star, but not the support¡ªthey were a bunch of awkward acting artists."
"All in all, an interesting and entertaining drama with good chemistry between the various actors and couples.  I would advise not watching it on an empty stomach as the food scenes were drool inducing; the various cuisine shots were definitely a feast for the eyes.  The characters were interesting, although pretty over-the-top in many cases - - the good guys were saints and the villains were evil to the point of being caricatures at times.  Even the little side story couples were fairly interesting, I actually liked the Victor/bicycle girl story the most, even though it was probably the most minor of the romance stories.  I especially liked the parents of the lead actress, they had great chemistry and actually seemed like a real couple.  The two girl villains, Elise and Xiaoyu, did a great job of making me really, REALLY hate them; I absolutely could not stand either of them and just wanted to slap the  out of them every time they appeared, especially Xiaoyu.  It did get draggy and drawn out at certain points but overall, moved along fairly well.  I gave it ten stars because I liked the overall drama and because the person I watched it with (a female) absolutely loved it, but actually, I would only have given it nine stars because . . . the ending, in my opinion, absolutely sucked!  It was such a fogivey, nicey-nice, everyone is forgiven, everyone is intrinsically good inside, ""My Little Pony"" world ending. i.e., EVERYONE ended up happy and forgiven, no matter how evil and reprehensibly despicable they were throughout the show. No one was really punished; the good guys forgave everyone and stopped them from being punished.  There was no real retribution whatsoever.  That may be fine with the people who like these pretentiously over-happy wrap ups, but in my opinion, it is unreal and weakened the overall story and writing.  It is basically saying that you can do all sorts of wicked and evil acts that destroy peoples' lives, but as long as you say, ""Oh golly, I've been such a naughty, naughty person.  I'm ever so sowwy.  Can you pwease forgive me?"" Then everything is all right in the world and everyone can be best friends forever!  It is advocating that evil actions should not receive any consequences or punishments as long as the evildoer just apologizes . . . oh puhleeze!  That is NOT the way things are, or should be, in the real world.  Wicked people rarely truly repent, or even feel the slightest remorse, for their self-serving wicked actions, and only ""apologize"" when they are caught in the act and know that their future profits and comfort will be jeopardized.  Their ""apologies"" tend to be little more than self-preserving shows of fake contriteness and are mostly down simply to avoid punishments or consequences of any kind.

  And I also thought the happy ending for the hero was too contrived and that it was obviously going to happen; of course I know it's what most viewers wanted, but these contrivances weaken the impact of dramas.  Endings that carry through with a touch of tragedy, although heartbreaking, generally result in better overall stories; two great examples are the Korean dramas, ""The Princess's Man"" in which a main character does end up blind, and the outstanding Kdrama, ""Remember"" which had a heartbreaking, but truly powerful ending--because of the tragicness of it.  The heroes in these two shows had sad fates but it strengthened the story and demonstrated the true love of the heroines because they chose to remain with them, and support them, for the rest of their lives; this resulted in a much richer story.

Anyways . . . those are my two main beefs with this show.  But like I said, I did enjoy this drama overall, and my partner LOVED IT (including, and especially, the ending.  She was one of those people who DID want everyone to end up happy and always wants a happy fairy-tale ending).  I think most everyone who watches this show will be pleased with it.  And the food scenes really are drool-worthy."
"Loved the chemistry between the leads, but I Found myself frustrated by the side stories. Its definitely a good show but too l




Loved the chemistry between the leads and wished for more of them. Found the sidestories frustrating and somewhat inconsequential which is why I give this an 8. The shallowness of some of these characters and petty selfish desires at the cost of anyone else also frustrates and irritates. That being said, I did binge this over a week period and that says alot for it. I've given up on dramas when they move too slowly before. This ran a tad slow for me attires but not enough to give up on it. The wonderful affection between Kesong and Jiang made me stick with it."
Very cute! I love them both. I want to see them together in the next show
"Bastante distinta, un poco m¨¢s larga de la cuenta  pero vali¨® la pena."
Amazing!!!!! I highly recommend!! You will fall in love with the actors!
I love Rakuten Viki but it sucks watching on air episodes  for newly released dramas since you have to wait days for  English subtitles  to be uploaded after the episode is  release I wish  viki was more like tencent video or  iQIYI  as soon as they release the episode English subtitles are available if this continues I will cancel my yearly plus subscription with Rakuten Viki I can¡¯t take waiting forever for subtitles I didn¡¯t want to mark this drama a low mark  of 1 star  because of the long wait for English subtitles since I have enjoyed watching it so far
"I have read other reviews, that mention how 'hot' the ML is. Can we talk about how abusive he is, regardless of his situation? Also Boris towards his apprentice, I just think it is time aggression and verbal/emotional abuse was no longer romanticised and normalised. Once again there is the crazy jealous female ex ,    yawn ! it is just overdone unimaginative writing.The 3 stars are for the food photography"
"Good fode, lovlig romance stores ?? ?? "
"I adore all foodie dramas ¡®cause I¡¯m a glutton & food lover! 
On the other hand, I am hooked from the beginning with all the gastronomical foods that were shown! It allowed me to see a more in depth of the Chinese cuisines! I could not tear my eyes away from the screen! I wanted a more in depth look at each & everyone of the dishes! 
I have watched countless dramas of both the male lead & female lead¡­ I would never have thought in a million years of their pairing! At first I was shocked, but then their chemistry & stellar acting proved me wrong! "
Loved this drama. Life lessons to be learned from watching this drama.
"To be honest, it was a totally different kind of drama. i did like it."
"Loved the characters, the acting¡­and the beautifully crafted dishes!"
"After watching this drama(only for Ethan ) I can't do it. The main actress is well I just can't watch her anymore. Are Chinese girl actress hard to find? I just can't. The drama might be great but for me, the main actor/actress should be appealing to the eye and she isn't.  After 28 episodes, I'm throwing in the towel. I'll just have to wait for Ethan Ruan's next drama"
Beautiful photography ¡­. Acting was excellent. Enjoyed this series.
"Overall I liked this. I have seen the FL in another series that was a college girl role so it was hard at first to view her in a more mature role especially since Kesong starts off more immature at the beginning but as she develops into a more womanly mature role through the story I felt that the actress was able to make me believe it. I had trouble at first with seeing the main couple as a good match with good chemistry but it felt believable by the end. I think the writers went a little wrong with the villains. They did such a good job selling us on how dark hearted they were that it was pretty jarring to have them suddenly flip back into nice people who just made a little mistake and suffered no consequences for their seriously criminal actions. Only poor Li Yan seemed to really suffer and his break-in was mild compared to what the others did. I guess Xiaoyu did suffer some burns but her radical change to sunny, smiley and kind seemed the least believable of all of them. Overall I enjoyed watching this show although I fast forwarded all the boring drawn out food sections of street vendors and food closeups that some other people commented they liked. Each to his own I guess. I agree with others that the very last dance scene was a little odd and didn't seem to match with the music. Maybe it would have seemed better if it was added like a bonus scene after the credits."
I love how he make  challenge s  which  makes you feel stronger 
How come Chinese drama dragged out too much? 40 episodes are insane.
"I give 10 STAR for both of them, They did a pretty good job. I love the story and it's a good one I hope the rating is a little bit higher. I can't wait for another drama working together. Ethan is older than Zu'er but the chemistry is so good."
Excellent drama.  Just watch it.  Lead actors have great chemistry.
Love the food porn!  The musical at the end was a bit out of place.
"Loving this so far. A big fan of Ethan Juan and also enjoyed watching Song Zu Er in the drama To Fly With You¡­¡­. and also love food dramas. 



far A big fan of Ethan Juan and really liked Song Zu Er in To Fly With You¡­¡­¡­"
"Sumptuous food photography......
But story was lacking!  Villains doing such evil and at the end just a slap on the hands.
Love EJ.... But not with that FL, she was way too young for him.
Totally skipped the side stories.  I found the mid episodes too boring. Overall, too many episodes in total 
The end dance scenes were random.... Oddly!  Enjoy the random dance off... "
"T? gostando muito, o triste ¨¦ q demora pra vir a tradu??o "
"Parece que ¨¦ bom. Ser¨¢?  legenda em portugu¨ºs,  por  favor!"
"Watch only if you like Ethan, otherwise don¡¯t bother with this drama. If you like food, there are much better dramas to watch.
FL was not that pretty at all. She acted like an immature teenager with an annoying girly voice.
No way that a much older, handsome and serious well known Chef would even give her a second glance.
No wonder there was no chemistry between the FL and the ML.
The story was too long with a weird ending and no punishment for the villains."
Nice story but too many episodes. THirty episodes would be enough
Very beautiful series of love and very good yummyyy??
Very beautiful series of love and very good yummyyy??
Good but I wish that it has more romantic scenes and a better end
I don't know the policies in China but can you just go telling anyone about another persons medical problems and the main lead is ok with this?  Isn't his lack of taste a secret and the doctor freely discusses it with Elise over and over again?  I realize it is to keep the plot moving forward but now it is just really annoying .
I like the plot and the story but I expected more for the ending
I love it! I love it! I love it!!!! ?? ???
I really liked this drama. I enjoyed how it showed the depth of true love and aspects of growth and redemption. I thought the Bollywood ending was fun. I never figured out who the actor who played Boris is.
"Nice story nice performance. Good job.
Beautiful and handsome ."
"Me encant¨®, los personajes muy bien interpretados "
"Estou dando avalia??o m¨¢xima pela sinopse.
Acredito que avaliar um drama pq a legenda ainda n?o est¨¢ dispon¨ªvel n?o seria justo, por outro lado me incomoda abrir a parte de cr¨ªticas e s¨® ver reclama??es por n?o ter legendas. 
Quando venho at¨¦ aqui espero encontrar a opini?o dos outros sobre o drama e n?o reclama??es sobre legendas.
Sim ¨¦ chato pagar por algo e n?o ter retorno, sim vc encontra o mesmo drama legendado em p¨¢ginas n?o pagas ( e isso sim ¨¦ um tiro no p¨¦) o problema aqui ¨¦ que dependemos de pessoas que se voluntariam para o projeto, por conta disso dramas extremamente bons ficam parados por meses esperando ser legendado ( ai vc acaba dropando o drama ou assiste gratuitamente em outro lugar) o que ¨¦ um saco.
Se est¨¢ cr¨ªtica valer de algo, Viki comecem a pagar aos tradutores.
Assim qdo vc vier ler uma cr¨ªtica, vc encontrar¨¢ a cr¨ªtica sobre o drama e n?o pela falta de legendas."
40 episodes and only 1 episode where the whole truth came out.
Too many foreigners in the show and slow character development
Would have gotten full marks except the ending was a bit blahh... and also I take issue with how the Dr. Was very morally wrong and no repercussions...  otherwise great show
This show does not deserve to be in the romance category. I¡¯ve been watching this on YouTube due to the delay in subtitles on this app. That wasn¡¯t really a big deal to me. What I¡¯m really disappointed in is the array of villains in this show. Elise can¡¯t act and seems to go unpunished for her evil deeds. There is very little chemistry between the ML and FL. The trailers for this drama is very misleading in terms of their relationship. I¡¯m very disappointed.
Muito bom Eu gostei muito do primeiro epis¨®dio Eu amo assim Dorama sabe de cozinhar assim de comida que chega d¨¢ ¨¢gua na boca voc¨ºs est?o de parab¨¦ns Amei o primeiro epis¨®dio n?o vejo a hora de assistir o segundo Que bom que voc¨ºs colocam legenda em portugu¨ºs porque eu sou brasileira e a aprecio muito voc¨ºs est?o de parab¨¦ns
Enjoyable¡­..a bit contrived¡­but worth the watch &  time.
I couldn¡¯t put it down. The cast was amazing. ????
"Love, I strongly recommend it . Very fun and emotional drama"
"I watched this show faithfully, nevertheless halfway through it started to become unrealistic. The romance between the leads seemed very shallow and not credible. The food styling was great but again minimalistic. If that is what gets you Michelin stars, they can keep it. I was looking for a full celebration of Authentic Chinese cuisine. Elise was a nut job who did not confront the consequences for her actions. The end was was too neatly sewn up. Otherwise Ethan Juan is a treat to watch and hope to see him in better roles in the future. He deserves them! It¡¯s an 8 because it entertained !"
I¡¯m sobbing while writing¡­ watch¡­.. this¡­.. now¡­.
"ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT  
Big number at the end didn¡¯t fit"
"Amazing story
Cute ending!! Love the lead actor and actress"
"I really enjoyed this drama, but I think the bad guys got too much screen time and didn't get the punishment they deserved. The last couple episodes seemed rushed to give a happy ending for everyone including those that hurt him."
"Update -  i found another site - they are up to 38.

Loveeeee love love this.   Cant wait rest of episodes after seen ep17 with english caps.  Thanks subtitle team keep up good work.

Cant believe both actors are dating in real life.  Thats why both are very good work well together."
"Booooring. Terrible scenario, full of holes, played out scenes and annoying one-dimensional characters that made it difficult to notice any decent acting. The 2 stars are for the beautiful food visuals and passable music. The rest was a total waste of time."
"Por favor , la traducci¨®n al espa?ol.. pago para ello.."
Too much repeat on Street food & last 10 mins a let down.
"Awesome, great use of the characters, no boring episodes."
Se podr¨ªa poner todos los cap¨ªtulos en espa?ol gracias
Really want to give it a 10 but there was a couple things that were a little too far stretched. But all in all the show was really good I was surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did. I like the ending until the  very end the outside dancing I didn't get but up till then it was very touching.  Anyway I would definitely recommend it as a nice story about you reap what you sow.... little more romance would have been nice but can't have everything.
"I have a love/hate relationship with cdramas, and this one pretty much has all the elements I hate. Waaay too many episodes, and it does nothing for the story. I can see myself skipping episodes. 

I love cooking/chef romance stories, and if you're looking for a really good one, I suggest ""The Perfect Match"". There's the age gap - older male chef, younger female apprentice, but it works sooo much better, and it's 22 episodes - which is right around the time I start to feel like it's time to wrap it up. The story is much more interesting, and the plot doesn't get so ridiculous. There's chemistry and the romance is believable.

There's zero chemistry between these two leads, and we've got the classic bullying by the male lead, the scorned ex, who just can't seem to move on, despite being accomplished attractive, and a storyline that becomes more unbelievable as it continues. It always takes the male lead waaay too long to figure out his ex is trying to ruin him. I should have stopped watching after Kesong drank the water out of the toilet. Whoever wrote that should be fired. 

Kesong is too young for Jiang Qian. I don't mind older men/younger women romance, but it doesn't work in this series. She acts like she's 13. I'm on the 12th episode, and I see no reason for him to see her as anything other than a ""little sister"". I actually wish he had chosen her sister, Lin Xiao. At least I wouldn't have been bored to death.

I don't like how Lin Xaio turned on her sister. Kesong is annoying, but she's not cruel, and doesn't deserve her sister's betrayal. "
Loved every thing but it the ending 
"Good movie
Love the movie and the cast
Really good movie"
"The end dance just did not belong to the drama, it was ugh! Fire the person who created that! The drama and actors were great!"
"Enjoying this show so much.  Great story line, leads are wonderful, food preparation never felt as romantic....As others have said, this show would be rated far more highly if people weren't using the review discussion to complain about the rate at which of episodes being subbed. This is both unfair to the show and unfair to viewers who may be off put if a show is in the lower end of the 9s.... I wish there were a way for Viki or teams to moderate this section so that comments re subs go where they belong in the comments section!"
"If you are a foody this is totally your show. Have snacks on hand while watching.   I ate through every episode. Some episodes dragged a bit and would have benefited from editing. Most actors played their roles to perfection.  Feel the villain of the story got off way to lightly with too many people covering it the deeds up  and even feeling sorry for the person. The ending was almost a miracle. The bullying by the top chef was a bit prolonged and sometimes verged on torture.  That said, I think many will enjoy this series as I did."
This was was great. Kept me watching till the very end.
"Its good, I enjoy it so much, but I feel a little long"
Loved it ! Great story line lots of  excitement ??
I was captivated the entire time. well worth the watch
No tiene todos los cap¨ªtulos subtitulado en espa?ol.
Estou louca pra assistir  mas estou esperando tamb¨¦m a legenda em portugu¨ºs. Por favor
"I'm lost for words. Enjoyed the cooking and showing of the food. I liked the ML, but did not like the FL for this story. I'm sorry, but they did not fit. The things that was done to him and they just got a slap on the hand. Wow!! Just wow. What happened with the writers of this series."
"A voir pour le fabuleux Ethan Ruan ! J'ai moins accroch¨¦ avec Song Zu Er qui est pour moi trop minaudante et parfois soulante dans le r?le de la ""petite chose pitoyable qui se fait marcher dessus par tout le monde"". Apr¨¨s cela il y a beaucoup de points positifs, notamment pour ceux qui aiment la gastronomie. Je le conseille !"
Awesome main cast . Very compatible pair. Great story
"I really like it so far, but it is still early. I will rate it again after its conclusion. I do have to note one thing...in the show's synopsis it states Ke Song follows her one-sided love to America. She followed him to Shanghai. This isn't the first time I have noticed discrepancies in a show's synopsis (i.e. Lucky With You synopsis was way off of what the show actually was about). Granted it will not keep me from watching, just something to note, I always let the trailers help me decide whether to watch or not. Really looking forward to the rest of Cupid's Kitchen!"
I kept thinking it was going to get good when the two main characters declared their love but it didn¡¯t.  It seemed to have left out some really good scenes that would have made the drama better.  I kept wanting more and it never delivered.  I gave it an 8 because of the actors.  Dating in the Kitchen was much better.
"I am loving what is starting to happen with the two main characters, they have amazing chemistry, just waiting for then to fall in love .episode 28 shows a little fun play with then ,but again in episode 25 it showed and again in 26 it showed a little.so excited for these two they need to reveal what Elise and doctor has done and fast"
"One of the best story related to food and cooking and also the romance, the intrigue, the twists in the plot. In addition the actors leading this drama are really a talented ones. Until now is perfect for me and the time I expended watching this jewel has been replenished for myself"
I¡¯m looking forward to seeing out the leads relationship progresses. She¡¯s quirky and has some insecurities while he is very mature and goal driven. I think this will be a really good series so I¡¯m looking forward to getting the English subs!
Just cutsi-poo enough among the Characters /:~ ). (Like everyone else who comments is bound to say: ..."Justice" did not prevail; not even close. Leaving a lot of viewers rather unsatisfied--and not Realistic[!]) Writers should not ::script::: the LadyManager doing-the-Crime/if-she-can't-do-the-Time!!!! \;~ (
Really good love story. All actors were outstanding.
I love watching dramas but honestly this show made me think twice. I watch all episodes and they spend all 37 episodes on bad and evil things they should have a little more romance and cute sceence with the ML and FL. What's up with the singing and dancing in the end. Very disappointed   
"Came for Ethan, stayed for Song Zu Er! Legend of Fuyao was my first C-drama. Loved every minute. Still dreaming of that that pool scene! Delighted to find Ethan in a Rom Com. Very much surprised by their excellent chemistry. The comedy is fab and Song Zu Er is very relatable and once she gets going her determination is inspiring to see. The end was lacking a little but ticked most boxes. The 2nd FL was terribly bad for the whole show, her behaviour was dreadful and she really wasn't punished in any satisfying way. We don't know what happened to the fall guy. Her mother wasn't much better. However, the concept was great, the competition fun, the filming made you hungry and more curious about cooking. The side characters were fab and well played and there was good character development for almost every character. I'm sad to say I don't know who Boris is, because he seems to be missing from every cast list! But he made an interesting and different enemy for the main character. His excellent Chinese was motivation and inspiration for all of us mere mortals silly enough to attempt learning the language. All in all this was a really enjoyable show that kept my interest to the end. Enjoy!"
"Sorry I think the drama is boring.  If I wanted to watch ALL cooking I would have watched a cooking show. This is a drama,  shouldn't there be a story in between the cooking ????"
"I love, love this drama. The foo preparations looked so goo.  The actors were terrific.  I love the suspense, the way they feel in love it was magical.   I will definitely watch this again."
"Putting this mostly cause people complaining about subs not coming out fast enough. If you have a problem, learn the language and sub it yourself. 

Actual rating right now more around 7 to 8 as of yet. I want to see more development in the story and the characters. Only thing i'm hoping for is they don't do a seoeration for a long period of time. Overused trope imo."
Really loved the story..... Loved this drama!??
We¡¯ll written and well portrayed. Enjoyed it 
"Super entretenida, tiene de todo un poco me encanta"
"Amando! Um trabalho danado para traduzir para portugu¨ºs, mas quando o enredo ¨¦ bom, vale tudo!
Quero que a Elise seja desmascarada logo, v¨ªbora! Que m¨¦dico anti¨¦tico compactuando com as loucuras da desequilibrada!"
Really enjoyed this but boy is it different from the novel.  Loved chemistry between MC.  At times some of the characters were written to be so annoying you could only think I want to slap them.  Two complaints: English translation slowest I have ever seen from Viki.  Don¡¯t get me wrong.  I could not enjoy Chinese novels or shows without the English translations so appreciate the work of the translation teams but it is frustrating to have so much lag.  Second was the slightly weird ending.  To morph from what could have been a fitting ending expressing love to the song and dance routine was little bizarre.  Other than those two items felt it was very well done and enjoyable.
Cupid¡¯s Kitchen or more like Cupid is Missing! It started off well then it became a series of unbelievable and anger inducing events. Elise is on another level if cray cray. I would have given this a higher rating if people actually got what they deserved
Great acting of all characters and a happy ending.
"(Tossing my hair) I love this so far cuz I just like the male and female lead, I think they flow well. He's older accomplished kinda the shit and cocky. She has about a ten yr difference and plays her roll well as the innocent bubble fun dingbat, but stands her ground as time comes and her lead is having her back as she has his. OH THE DRAMA,  isn't that what we're here for people. It's up beat, and girls we know we had our evil sides, ..shit cooking competition,  love, secrets. Can't wait to see it all unfold."
"In one word: delightful. Really enjoying  it. If you expect the kitchen to get very hot, you will be disappointed. Romance is not the focus of this drama. Ethan Juan and SZE are doing a great job, their interaction is so palpable. He is an arrogant artist and she is young and carefree. They complement each other perfectly. Amazing dishes. "
"Male lead was good in his role. The actress that played the ex-girlfriend was awful. And it looks like they did a voice over & that made it worse. I did like seeing the Canadian guy in the movie. It looked like he was actually doing his own voice, if not his lips moved like he was actually speaking Chinese. Too many episodes so I skipped some. Ending was weird didn¡¯t care for it.  The show had nothing to do with dancing."
"I have been a fan of Ethan Juan for a long time, and got really excited about watching him in this new drama.  Couldn't wait for each new episode to become available.  But about 3/4 into the series, the whole storyline fell on its behind and didn't get back up!  I felt like the actors  started playing a game of ""let's all talk backwards and see how quickly we can confuse everybody""!"
"Love this series.  Only one thing, Elsie  shouldn¡¯t be let go that easy.  She did very evil.  Ethan is super good.  I was watching this and Fated to love you at the same time.  He can be all of or very loving. Perfect????????"
Sympathische Schauspieler und mag die Geschichte
"Disappointing.  Series too long for this type of story.  Uninteresting side stories.  Story unrealistic, especially towards the end.  Everybody lived happily ever after, even the would be murderess.  ML and FL characters were not appealing.   Nothing like Dating In The Kitchen."
"10/10 for the food. It looks incredible and will make whatever you are eating feel inferior. You need fancy snacks for this show.
HOWEVER, without giving too much away, it's 40 episodes with some truly evil characters that don't get even close to the punishment they deserve. Very disappointing, although you will love Blu and Huang and even Victor at times they also make questionable life choices and deserve better. Pretty predictable plot but not a satisfying ending."
"Dei 10 estrelas, pois eu pessoalmente gostei dessa serie, apesar do final, que deixou muito a desejar, nao vou dizer porque, para nao dar spoiler, e o romance so comeca quase no final, tirando isso e uma serie interessante."
"I love Lareina and Ethan. Love the music, the food information, plot. It was very good. It had the usual basics, but with very unique differences of dramas of food dramas. It was informative, pleasant yet didn¡¯t have super annoying antagonists."
"Main storyline between the leads was cute, and acting was good by both. However, there was so many secondary storylines (and plenty of evildowers) which were a borefest and could have been easily wrapped up in 30 episodes; nor did the writers convinced me to emphathized with their actions or for their lack of any moral compass. The acting by the supporting cast was at best inconsistent and not as good either, making this series at times seems to dragged."
"I was ready to rate this 9.5 plus¡­ but lack of resolution of evil doers  leads me to rate it lower¡­ (as if writers went on hiatus snd phoned in last 10 episodes).I liked the leads. I thought the other cast  members were good. I prefer Korean  tv usually, but the culinary  scenes in this were super, and leads were believable and comfortable with role as mentor/  mentee(sic).


Thank god for  40¡­ change to a 9.5! ( Should have arrested Elise!) Nonetheless, I upped my knowledge of culinary arts and have better opinion of Mainland Telenovelas."
"- Bom, assisti o 1¡ã EP em PT nessa madrugada e j¨¢ ameii <3 Tenho certeza que vou adorar esse c-drama do in¨ªcio ao fim. Tem dias que eu estava procurando ele legendado em outras plataformas e n?o encontrava de jeito nenhum. Estou contente por terem legendado o mais r¨¢pido q puderam. Obrigadaa ???"
"Breaking it down to 
5 for the very delicious thoughtful process of food. O dont watch it on an empty stomach.
5 for the sweet servings of both leads. Not much skinship but the chemistry is there.
And Ethan is yummy as always.
Now for the unsavory part.
I finished watching it on Chinese New Year on YT. 
The story isn't cohesive and there were lots of skippings on unnecessary secondary couples.
Then this drama really go against the grain of justice. The main villian  and her beau escaped prison when throughout the show they were trying to destroy the ML.
And only one that took bribes,  home invasion was jailed?
Certainly a let down for many, plus a surprise song and dance at the end...humph.
Could easily be a 24 episodes drama.
Ethan is just too scrumptious for me to give it less than 10!!"
Gostei muito mais ficaria melhor em portugu¨ºs
"This drama was not great it had lovable moments but it dragged toward the end and certain characters storyline was rushed. The cousin battle did not sit well to me was not a real victory imo. Few characters development is the only good thing about this drama Lin Kesong (female lead), Boris, Victor & Lin Xiaoyue. Elise & Dr story was rushed towards end an horrible & unbelievable. The OST was great loved the music."
"What a crappy drama! I came for Ethan and had to force myself to keep watching each episode.. 7 episodes in and I just can't do it anymore! Why did they cast someone who looks and speaks like a child to be the FL?? God I can't stomach it! 
Ethan is a gorgeous, well seasoned, mature actor acting with a child who shouldn't be the FL! Don't even get me started about the other characters... seriously this is such a disappointedly waste  of time! "
"Dei dez estrelas pela promessa do drama , por¨¦m onde est?o as legendas em portugu¨ºs?
Demorando muito em Dna viki!?"
"Wow, this is going to be hard to rate.  I liked the show, it kept me going but that doctor and Elise...wow... she ends up going to Transylvania.  Seems like one would get a stiffer penalty for poisioning someone  and if nothing else the doc should have lost his license.   I didn't get the end.  Love that form of dancing just didn't see it for an ending especially for this show.   Liked the uncle, his cooks, and I think there was a good message between the cousins, especially the jealous, competitive one.  Boris finally came around.  But for the rest of it, I really thought there would be or could have been a better ending."
Stayed for the food visuals and the heroine.  Didn't like the fact that Elise and her accomplices almost got away with murder and went along their merry way.
"Ethan must be needing money to do a drama like this.  He is a good actor so a drama with more substance is his normal level.  There is a 16 yr age gap (nothing wrong with that), but if the production casts them, then they should just have some kissing scenes for a romantic drama.  Similarly ""My Treasure"" with Roy and Vicki, huge age gap, no touching, just chem...so not realistic, but there have been several Chinese dramas that keep casting older guys with young FLs."
This was a beautiful show and it should have gotten a 10. But the fact that the people responsible for jiangs blindness and loss of taste got away with a happy ending did not sit well with me.
"Contemplated dropping the series at episode 7 but decided to continue after one week. I love the food scenes, storyline is ok but a few of the actors, they can do better. So far at episode 30 the characters I like are Lin Ke Song's uncle and her parents, ever supportive and proud of her. Sadly watched the rest of the series for the food, Ethan Juan and not, for the storyline. Too many villains, eventually the biggest one got away with a slap on the wrist and the closing for the final episode with the song and dance? Oli found his sweetness, but with 40 episodes that is stretching the story."
"Ethan and Song are wonderful in this story, their chemistry is awesome. I will probably rewatch this story again, it is that much fun. There is a LOT going on with the cast, backstories, and so on. The actors playing the villains will make you hate them, so they are doing a great job with their roles. Overall, sit back and enjoy the ride, there is a little bit of everything in this one."
"Avevo grandissime aspettative su questo drama , ma sono stata delusa. La storia non ¨¨ male, ma se credete di trovare un coinvolgimento emotivo e passione, allora guardate altro. Qualcuno l'ha paragonata a DATING IN THE KITCHEN,  niente di pi¨´ sbagliato! Sono 2 cose completamente diverse anche se ambientate in cucina. In ""Dating in the kitchen "" la storia punta principalmente sul romance e sulla storia d'amore. In Cupid's kitchen invece, la storia ¨¨ incentrata sulla cucina e sulla volont¨¤ di imparare e crescere della protagonista e anche del ML. Niente baci appassionati o scene intime, solo qualche innocente bacetto a labbra serrate verso la fine. Ma non ¨¨ una questione di et¨¤ o di differenza di et¨¤ con il ML. Zhao Lusi aveva 22 anni e Lin Shen 40 anni in Dating in the kitchen eppure chi lo ha visto ricorda le loro scene insieme. Purtroppo qui la protagonista sembra una ragazzina di 15 anni ed ¨¨ proprio questo suo aspetto che era forse inappropriato per scene diverse. Non so se ci saranno i sub ita, per cui l'ho seguito in inglese. Non esprimo giudizi sul consigliarlo o meno perch¨¦ i gusti sono soggettivi. Io non lo rivedrei nemmeno con i sub ita. Se volete una bella storia che parli di cibo e cucina, Dating in the kitchen resta inarrivabile. Vi consiglio per¨° anche un altro drama bellissimo sempre sullo stesso stile e con tantissimo amore "" THE PERFECT MATCH""  Guardatelo, non ve ne pentirete!"
"I love watching all the food scenes. I rated 8/10 because the acting was mediocre.  The crying scenes from the male lead were so bad, it didn¡¯t move me a bit.  I watched this show because of him from Legend of Fuyao, but disappointed with the acting of this show.  He doesn¡¯t express much emotions.  I don¡¯t feel the romantic connection between the lead characters."
"WARNING! You will be hungry when you watch each episode, lol. Best guess is if you watch Asian shows you probably like Asian food and let me tell you, the food looks delicious! Now to the actual series. This was better than I thought it would be. The trailer did not sell me. I watched because of Ethan Juan (the ML). Man, he¡¯s hot! In great shape and super sexy in the chef uniform. The FL is charming. She did a really good job. I really liked the other couples too and the arch-nemesis storyline plus his redemption. They didn¡¯t play into the stereotypical characters. For example, the FL best friend is a guy who is dating a rich girl. The rich girl he¡¯s dating isn¡¯t a bitch and doesn¡¯t act spoiled. She¡¯s actually pretty cool which the FL best friend realizes in the end. They really did a good job with the cinematography in this show by highlighting the food."
A bit depressing and annoying for 95% of the series¡­.there were a lot of times that the FL had me cracking up¡­very talented young actress & cute. Although not my fav kdrama by far¡­nor my fav E.J. show. Desperately hoping he does a follow up to Fuyao before he stops acting completely!
"I really enjoyed this drama. I did not skip any of the 40 episodes. If you love food and cooking then, this drama is for you. The dishes look really mouth watering. The ML is really hot and the evolution of his behaviour is interesting. I saw him in Fated to love, while I was translating into French and did not like him at all. But in this drama his acting is fantastic. The FL looks like a child at the beginning of the drama but you see her turning into a lovely young woman in the end.The other characters are quite interesting. Just one thing annoyed me and disappointed me a lot but it was in the last episode so it did not spoil the whole thing."
Det ?r en bra serie men slutet var d?lig
Absolutely one of the best cdrama! Love!!
Good drama for light hearted fun to watch
Muito fofo eu amei de verdade essa s¨¦rie
Good drama for light hearted fun to watch
I would give this a nine but then the last 15 min of dance caught me off guard.  A very okay drama then ending with a cheap dance routine wtf good unto the last 15 min
I am in love with  this show.  Ethan Juan and Song Zu Er are fabulous.  In today's world a great escape...The food sequences are terrific..  Will enter comments at end of series.
I just want to say that the subbers working on this drama are excellent!!! Y¡¯all are working so hard to get the subtitles finished!
"Mostly I like this drama. The premise is good, but like a lot of C-drama's it drags a lot in the middle. episode 19 to 23 are the worst. lot's of unnecessary side stories, long boring conversations, etc, etc. after those episodes the story telling gets good again. I also feel that certain story lines are dragged on too long.

Finished the drama today. Too bad the pacing of the last few episodes was all over the place. I also feel the end is rushed. And the dance at the end.......

Over all a solid drama, but could have been done much better on certain area's.

I was actually surprised I was drawn into this drama. It is not the usual type I watch."
"Cute drama but too unrealistic.  Young woman with no cooking experience becomes a contender in a highly competitive cooking competition; Man who is poisoned loses sense of taste and then sight then becomes cured after receiving an experimental drug that almost kills him, etc."
It¡¯s alright. The story is cute and predictable. Spends too much time on flashbacks and reminiscing. The biggest flaw was using foreigners that don¡¯t speak the language¡­the voice dubbing is not matching the movement of the mouth¡­that is really irritating. And the details are all missed making the impossible come alive on screen just turns it into a joke. It¡¯s a good drama as a filler¡­just to keep busy.
"Sorry Vic
I cheated and went to You Tube . I'm on episode 37 now. 
This month I was  not  able to afford the pass .Could  you please stop freezing every commercial that runs .
I really enjoyed Cupids  Kitchen."
I stopped at episode 6. I wasn¡¯t feeling the story or the leads. I usually love him but I guess the writers should¡¯ve done a better job.  I tried to skip some episodes and still people got away with the things they did and the FL paid the price at times. Have it a shot but couldn¡¯t go any further.
"First off, how can someone who doesn¡¯t even possess slicing skills be entered into a high class cooking competition? I watched this because of Ethan Juan, a great actor that I¡¯ve been following over the years. He can¡¯t save this preposterous story though¡ªI stopped watching at episode 32 when I saw the previews of him going blind on YouTube. Fiction doesn¡¯t have to be that close to reality but this screenplay is an insult to your audience who can see how illogical the storyline is. 

Also, hire a mandarin-speaking actress please. The villainess here may be good but when I noticed her dubbing out of sync, I looked closely and could decipher she¡¯s speaking in English¡ªthe English subtitles were in sync with her lips but not the Chinese dubbing. 

I"
"I'm going to start by saying that I agree with a lot of the negative reviews. But the sugar sweetness of the show made me overlook...issues. I'm a sucker for romance?¡â?
Anyway, I always suggest reading negative reviews , and in this case, I highly recommend it. But I liked the show!"
"I actually find this drama so far to be quite entertaining. I noticed it¡¯s 40 episodes so there should be many things happening. Even though there¡¯s an age gap between the leads I don¡¯t mind, they have great chemistry."
"I loved this story so much that I¡¯ve watched it so many times already. 
The lead actress was strong, very intelligent, brave and was not afraid to speak her mind or challenge anyone. She was funny, straightforward, no nonsense and I loved her strong character.I found this young actress an absolute joy to watch.
In contrast, I found the ML to be verbally and physically abusive towards her and I did not like his character. He was paranoid, insecure and rather gullible in trusting some of the wrong people around him. (I found it to be a case of, ¡°your worst enemy could be your best friend and your best friend your worst enemy.¡±
How he failed to suspect the person close to him of poisoning him, is rather unbelievable and yet, after knowing that his personal doctor and his ex-psycho girlfriend were collusion, beggars belief.
I preferred the second ML and hoped that he and the first FL would end up together.
He was a far better character than the abusive mentor who kept calling her dumb, stupid and dummy, which I did not like.
Overall, I loved this drama because of the FL. ??????????????????????????????????????????????????"
"Actors very good but poor script.
Too much bad happens while the happiness is only for 5-7 minutes before the end. That bitch had to be put in prison way before together w the doctor,"
"If I could, I would rate 20 for the food porn here. For the romance, the slow-burning simmer builds up convincingly for the two with different backgrounds, 10 years in age gap, and prior baggage. I'm sure it will turn into a blaze when they realize they are in love."
"Gente esse drama ¨¦ mto bom !!! As cenas das comidas s?o lindas bem feitas !! Quem ama essa tem¨¢tica de vai pirar !! Casal principal n?o curti mto apesar da mocinha ser bem gente boa!! o casal secund¨¢rio foi bem mais fofinhos bomm !! assistam  no entanto s¨® merece  pq a  bonitinhaaa apronta todas em nome do amor e nem ¨¦ presa ¨¦ uma vitima  se fosse pobre estava ate hoje mofando na cadeia !!! N?o curti ,"
"It started out well, but then the ending was bad. No consequences for the villains in this drama."
"Um drama RAN?OSO (assisti at¨¦ ep. 20 e desisti). Enredo simpl¨®rio com tramas mesquinhas, o protagonista  masculino tem uma personalidade ASQUEROSA, al¨¦m  de ser TOSCO, GROSSEIRO, EGO¨ªSTA? E BURRO? agiu e tomou decis?es idiotas e n?o se desculpou ou se redimiu dos erros, o personagem n?o evoluiu no decorrer da trama. Protagonista feminina sem sal, trouxa, passiva, sem atitude com rela??o aos acontecimentos. O drama prometia uma boa hist¨®ria, mas na minha opini?o, n?o foi bem desenvolvido, fiquei na torcida at¨¦ o vig¨¦simo epis¨®dio, ansiando pelas mudan?as para melhor dos personagens q n?o ocorreu de maneira siginficativa e cativante,  uma pena."
"Interesting drama!  When it comes to food I'm all for it, quite an insight I must say. This drama has a lot of bad people with ill intentions, they need a good slap in the face or worst!!!  So far I am enjoying it but not liking the the  annoying irritating OST 'Love is Food' the singer sound like she is constipated...lol ...they could pick a better song than that."
"Love watching them both, however just a few nitpick on too many unnecessary scenes with other characters, it was not interesting, I felt victors scenes were totally irreverent. They could have also got a chinese speaking Elise.. it was annoying watching her being dubbed..and how annoying was her cousin xiaoyu.. she didn¡¯t deserve to have Blu¡¯s attention. All in all, it was an enjoyable watch, I felt they didn¡¯t have enough scenes with the female and male lead, that¡¯s why they needed to bring in other unnecessary character scenes to make this drama longer. When are the chinese ever going to learn that it¡¯s not the quantity, but quality of the show that matters most?"
Love it. The food looked amazing. Love their acting. Wish they would have shown them get married and Nina watching theirs kids at the end!!! But I give it a 10!!!
"I'm giving this a 9 so far. I'm enjoying the story, the character development, and preparation of the yummy looking food specialties.
I can feel chemistry building up as the two protagonists work/fight together. Their relationship is fun to watch. I only wish ML would be honest with FL as to his disability. She would understand his urgency to teach her the skills she needs to be a successful chef. As the story develops, I will give more input. So far so good.

O.K., I completed the series, and will maintain my 9 rating. I get tired of the way some of the characters are depicted as totally selfish, evil, coniving creatures who seem to delight in torturing the main protagonists. Although they eventually see the error of their ways, so much damage has been inflicted, and all we want to see is real punishment, not redemption.
Basically, I enjoyed the series, and it kept me on edge as to how the writers were going to resolve the issues that the ML faced.  It's worth the watch, so enjoy."
"So far up to ep. 17 it has been fairly good. The description says FL follows her crush to America but that certainly doesn't look like the U.S. to me. I am usually a fan of Ethan Ruan but he seems to be doing a bit of over-acting in some of his emotional scenes. However, this maybe the fault of the director. ..... Have now completed this series and I must say it improved greatly and I was happy to see the FL and ML characters develope their emotional connection to one another. Love the young Canadian man's character and hope that actor gets more parts. However, I could not understand what the writer was thinking in regards to the how the 2nd FL could just be allowed to carry on by everyone around her. All around good show and worth the watch."
"It was a 10 up until the last 3 episodes . Then the subs disappeared . So disappointing.Then, the very ending was completely out of place . What on earth were they thinking! They never should have tried for an Indian ending. Skewed the whole movie!"
"O drama ¨¦ maravilhoso, mas me pergunto onde est¨¢ as legendas . Pago VIKI PLUS para esperar  n?o sei por qtos tempo as legendas. Sendo que nos FANSUBS j¨¢ est?o vindo legendado os epis¨®dios e s?o de gra?a. Porque pago a VIKI se s¨® passo raiva e decep??o, meu dinheiro n?o cai do c¨¦u n?o, suo muito para ganhar e vcs n?o respeitam os assinantes acha que somos palha?os ."
"I only saw this because of Ethan Juan, the main actor, but was soooo disappointed in his acting skills.  His old, low-budget movies were far superior compared to Cupid¡¯s Kitchen. He proved unable to express needed emotion.  The story was cute , as well as a good job from Song Zoer, but she couldn¡¯t redeem his stiff/emotionless acting which he was so good at 10  years ago.  Skim through to get the story but prepare & cover your eyes & ears for his substantial lack of chemistry."
So tired of shouty bullying men. Why are we training women to think this nonsense is attractive??
"I loved this show. Almost didn't watch it because of the reviews. I'm giving it a 9 because the bad guys went unpunished and felt like it ended abruptly. I didn't care for the other couples but it was a nice distraction from all the problems. 

FYI - Comment section is full of uncouth, silly, body shammers. I do hope all the people commenting negatively on the FL's beauty/body are sitting pretty with their beauty crowns. "
"Muitas pessoas reclamam e muitas elogiam. N?o sei como ¨¦ dificil fazer um Dorama, mas seu como ¨¦ f¨¢cil estragar o Dorama.

Aqui o autor bateu muito forte nas brigas,  trapa?as e problemas de personalidade  dos personagens.

Os secund¨¢rios acabaram fazendo o show demorar a acabar, isso eu sei ¨¦ cansativo, mas n?o houve aqui o exagero de mal entendido e humilha??o e arrasta arrasta das mulheres. Mesmo eu sendo homem n?o acho isso v¨¢lido.

O final foi express e muita coisa deveria ter tido suas explica??es e Victor deveria ter sido eliminado por trapa?a.

No geral eu recomendo. A atriz ¨¦ meiga e simples.

"I am at episode 23 and that is where many Chinese dramas start to drag and the thought that there are a total of 40 episodes seems daunting; they are just too many for the plot. Part of the reason is the obsessive Elize character, horribly written, horribly acted, what a ridiculous plot device and what's with the Dr. who likes her, WHY? he should have called the police, which would have meant her character would be in jail and less worthless episodes."
"I like what I've seen so far despite the long delays with the English translation which is Viki's domain.  I hope the chemistry starts to improve between the two leads.  I'm not 100% enthralled with the female lead. Too immature but perhaps her character will blossom from her childlike mannerisms to being a desirable young lady.  The male lead is one to watch and become totally engrossed in his backstory.  The BEST part of this drama is the actual videography, music and sound.  The introduction is mouthwatering eye candy!  Being a foodie and lover of Asian drama, I am so very hopeful I can come back and give it a 10 by the show's end. An update may be on the horizon."
"I really like this show. The characters are pretty straight forward. The male and female leads are delightful. I love plots that have characters who grow over time. I think this is one those instances where I wonder what kind of turns and twist will take place in the relationships that exist between the characters. Very cool series!

Also, I want to thank the folks who translate the series for us. We could not enjoy it without the time and effort you put into this."
"37 episodes in and the villain is still getting away with it.  How can her mother, the Dr., the scapegoat, and Elise all choose not to tell Oliver?  So frustrating!!!!  Also, how in the heck are they still not a couple?  Yea there is some leaning, talking, etc.  but he has yet to admit his feelings for her.  Ugh!!!  Who knows, maybe episode 38 will suddenly surprise me.

Ok, now finished with drama and hardly any romance in the 30 episodes.  The story was good, I just wish the lead couple had more romantic couple moments.   "
"Minha avalia??o n?o ¨¦ para o dorama que vem sendo muito bom, mas sim para o app que n?o disponibiliza legenda em portugu¨ºs mesmo com o servi?o pago.."
I can not wait to watch the next ep .... this movie is everything love love love it
I have to say I¡¯m a fan of Ethen and the part he played was excellent. It was if he really could not see or taste. I liked the cooking projects it made me hungry. I loved the music and the special treat at the end. I would like to see this one again.
"Very nice drama, I enjoyed it a lot.  Ethan Juan is such a great actor! He looks so young and boyish and his chemistry with Song Zu Er was amazing.  Acting next to Ethan Juan, Song Zu Er grew as an actress in this drama, she found the balance between being a cute naive girl and a woman in love discovering herself. "
"I only could get through episode 7 ¡­ the chemistry was odd , there was overacting by the second lead and poorly written personality issue with many of the cast . But the food looked amazing . That was the best thing about it all . "
"I like the FL since The Bond and I still do. The ML is a bit too cocky for me and most everyone else, well, if you call that acting, then I¡¯m going to go bang my head on the wall. Horrible does not even begin to describe it. No chemistry between the leads maybe cuz the age gap."
"Solo primi 5 episodi sottotitolati in italiano,, una settimana fa era solo il primo,, c'¨¨ speranza?!?!?!!! Speriamo allora finora la serie ¨¨ interessatnte,, la valutazione ¨¨ solo perch¨¦ non ci sono i sottotitoli in tt le puntate,, se ho fortuna, riuscir¨° a dare tt le stelline!!"
"Super love this drama FL was hard working, loyal and optimistic. ML was arrogant, talented but great teaching ability. Their cooking really inspired me back in the kitchen. I liked the story overall although there were parts that I hated because it didn't make sense. I also thought that after the friend realized his feelings and was trying to make something of himself why did he give up at the end. it just seemed an unnecessary plot line. The dancing scene definitely gave it a happy vibe but it could of been toned down a notch."
"Como lo puedo ver en espa?ol ,parece que esta buena pero nose puede ver en espa?ol"
This is such a cute and moving show. I really enjoyed the strong women characters especially the main character. I think the chemistry between the two main actress and actor is great. I would love to see these two main characters in another show together soon. I will watch this show again.
"SIMPLISMENTE AMEI ,,,pena que demora para traduzir  vi em outro aplicativo mas  parab¨¦ns aos atores , ele eu  n?o conhecia supreendente interpreta??o  rica ..ela uma fofa ..historia de supera??o e claro romance ..com ele que hahha um gato"
This show was a waste of time and the writing was hot garbage.
I enjoyed this show. It had the usual mix of angst and happiness. The only character who truly annoyed was Elise.
"An impressive performance by Ethan Ruan, who just gets better and better with age.  Kudos to the director and cinematographers, who created a wonderful visual experience.  Yes, there were a few missteps plot wise and from some actors, but I thoroughly enjoyed this."
"If I could give one piece of advice to viewers, it would be to not read the book before watching the show completely. You will end up feeling so incredibly disappointed. 

I really loved the first few episodes and got impatient so I found an English translation of the book online. Huge mistake! The screenwriter completely butchered the original author¡¯s work! I was so irritated throughout the series and skipped many scenes. So many unnecessary evil characters in the show didn¡¯t even exist in the book. Ke Song was a much stronger person who could kick ass and eventually cook. Qian Fan was cool and calm without crazy angry outbursts. And their relationship was just hot in the book! 

Why did the screenwriter do this to Ethan Juan and Song Zu Er?! This show could have been sooo much better! The leads had so much wasted chemistry! 

I know it sounds like I completely hated the show but the two main leads and the delicious foods did make the show enjoyable and that¡¯s why I gave it 8 stars. "
SIGH. The main leads are awesome together.  The beginning was promising.  The middle was mostly watchable.  The end was baffling.   Consequences don't apply. Waste of time.
"A great series! I really enjoy romance/cooking shows¡­all started for me with Pasta.
The characters were very well-played.  Kaesong & Qianfan were a cute couple but certainly could have had more romance included.
Ranran was great!
Thought the older couple developing relationship was well done & nice to see.
Elise¡¯s role was too long/too much damaging actions without significant consequences.
Enjoyed seeing some of the wonderful food presentations.  Makes one want to visit China and take a cuisine tour!!"
ML and FL did Stella job in their roles. Chemistry was just right. Some super annoying characters and acting really let the show down. Ending could have done with some more attention as well felt rushed to end things but didn't get to finish it off nicely
I'm stopping at ep 30 for now. Maybe I'll come back to this one.  Love Ethan & the food but the romance is lackluster (pretty much none so far & we're 3/4 of the way through) as well as a lot of uninteresting side stories. The quality is good but there was so much unfulfilled promise that I'm disappointed.  Yet another c-drama I will drop... :(
"The opening sequence, particularly the opening theme song is uplifting and who wouldn't want to watch a show with a theme song that has the lyrics ""Love is the food for the living heart"". Early on, but so far enjoyable."
"The quality of the photographic , video  and music in the introduction is amazing and if you add beautiful way the actress act as an apprentice make you love the show and the food presented.

The principal couple is delightful to see, the chemistry  between the actors is so good that make you wish more shows with them because they make you feel that they really fall in love."
"I really enjoyed the aesthetics of the culinary aspects and the chemistry between leads. 

***Spoiler***After JQ went into the hospital it felt so rushed and unrealistic. Alt theory: he actually died as they were trying to revive him. The ending we saw was LK¡¯s dreams that we kept getting through out the drama. "
"The series started out with humor,transitioned to emotional, and back to happiness. Could have  done without the flash mob dancing at the end. The actors in this series were superb, the writers did a spectacular job segueing from one scene to the next seamlessly. Really appreciated the pairing of actors who played well off one another. Overall the best feel  good series that I have had the pleasure in watching from beginning to end!!"
"Great chemistry between the two leads, albeit he looked too old for her. Was concerned that he took the illicit black market drug and his health fully recovered (miraculously). Not terribly realistic. Why did the one who poisoned him get away with it so easily and be forgiven?  Curious? Everyone dancing at the end seemed a bit silly.  However, overall I found the series good and addictive and could not stop watching."
"Stayed for the amazing food only.  Storyline a little silly. Overall, no regrets watching the series."
Great show the male and female leads were darling great  acting I have seen her in several shows very versatile loved the ending with the dancing

Apenas at¨¦ o epis¨®dio 5 tem a legenda  em portugu¨ºs.
"I enjoyed the series a lot, but the English translation had a lot of editing issues. Lots of misspellings and wrong word substitution. For example the subtitles say sign instead of sing or smell instead of sight. It is not the fault of the drama so will not lower the rating, but if spelling and grammar mistakes bug you a lot you may want to avoid."
I'm enjoying every mintue waiting . i just love that the espisodes are 40 + min. And you show at least 3 shows a day. The actors and actress are wonderful so true to their chacters. And the food scenes are great. It would take me forever to go into details.   But it's 10 for me
"Watched all episodes, thinking by the end all of the frustrating plot lines would resolve somehow. Main actors were earnest which is why I gave it a 3, but plot resolutions so awful that I couldn¡¯t give more. First time I¡¯ve watched something on Viki that I wish I had my time back."
The show had potential in the beginning but the story felt very rushed at the end. I felt the romance was dragged out a bit and now all of a sudden they are all about each other. I¡¯m disappointed with how the show ended and I would not recommend. You will waste your time.
I really like how this drama started but really guys 28 episodes out of 40 and there is still no clear romantic growth. I feel like I wasted my time to be honest. The director could have just made some cute moments while cooking or something but to no Avail!. If the last 12 episodes are just dramatic with no romance I will be so disappointed. Such waste of such good characters they look cute together.
Great story. Funny and serious all in one. Great acting by Ethan and Syuer.

"What is up with casting? The FL looks like she is still in high school . It really makes it hard to watch, feel like you are watching a pedo checking out a little girl.  Sometimes I wonder casting???"
"Very lovely movie from beginning to the so satisfying excellent piece of work so impressed and deeply touched by the kindness of the human heart if you learn to forgive and learn to love ?   ? ?    overjoyed thank you

"Drama riche en ¨¦motions, joie, rire, tristesse, col¨¨re  tout y passe.  Les parties culinaires sont int¨¦ressantes et nous montrent la pr¨¦cision de la cuisine ainsi que la richesse de la cuisine chinoise.

"Mostra a culin¨¢ria chinesa, um drama gostoso de assistir. Adoro os protas, assistindo por eles."
I love Ethan. He¡¯s so sexy!! I would give him a 10 but pairing him with this actress does nothing for him.  Her low voice is annoying and the voice overs are gringy. Elise can¡¯t act and the other non Asian cast is driving me nuts. I¡¯ll keep skipping and only watch the food scenes. Love the music. 
Legenda portugu¨ºs por favor 
"I love it!!??? Each character had a lot of growing up to do. Situations will take you out your comfort zone. Don't let nothing stop you. However, don't hurt others in the process. I love the ML and FL chemistry. I will watch this again. Love conquers all. Be truthful."

"The show would be good so far but it really makes me angry that once you
get involved in a show, the subtitles disappear.  Is it your policy to take people's money for a subscription and not give them proper service for it?
One of your episodes only has 91 percent subtitles and the very next only has
40.  It is also rare that you have any new shows and when you do, they can't
be watched due to the subtitles. If you take our money for the subscriptions, 
pay people to do it properly.  I am really considering cancelling this service and
looking for other means to watch these shows."
The actors were great the drama was was great not understanding the big dance number at the end and the big missing parts of the subtitles in the drama it made it hard it understand the story line in some places. But love the actors would love to see them again.
"This was such a wonderfully delightful drama.  I'm really enjoying all of the Chinese dramas that I have watched.  There are so many or all of the parts needed to make a drama enjoyable.  There's suspense, anxiety, adventure, learning experiences, subtle romance, sadness and happiness.  There's much to make you want to watch it over again . Thank you for the great story, acting and directing."
"Loving this so far, its just ...the age gap between QianFan and KeSong just squicks me. If she was just a few years older it wouldn't bug me so much.
Cause I'm not going to lie, the power dynamics here often feel like their skirting right on the edge of creepy, and a hair's width of good intention from downright abusive and toxic.
The fact Qianfan genuinely wants to help Kesong grow as a person and a chef is what keeps it out of ""ewww creepy"" waters."
????????????????????????
"The beginning of each episode made me hungry. The food representation was excellent. As for the actors, they were very professional in portraying chiefs. The main actors, the main chef and his apprentice had good chemistry despite the age difference. As for the villian, she shouldn't have gotten off.  I gave this a ten star rating for the actors and story. Beautifully done!"
"Is a really good story, good actors, incredible recipes. The only problem is with the translator, right now chapter 20-22 have not CC at all. For the people that we do not speak the language is a huge problem. I have to wait one more week for the CC is complete, Viki pays attention to this matter. I pay for the service, so I deserve good translate."
The main lead actress is annoying to watch.  It is almost like she likes being stepped on or being misused all the time. At times it is hard to watch her act like a child and behave like a child.  The main actor does not have any reservations about his partner and ex-girlfriend who poison him is unbelievable.  He is so consumed in his cooking and health issues that he never once think that she would want to harm him that is annoying to watch.  The kid actor Vikor is also hard to watch the whole family toxic.  This show is toxic to watch
I enjoy the explanations for the food science to cooking. They don't gloss over the food prep simply for the evolving love story.
I really like the chemistry and romance. The introspective thoughts and food porn is pretty great.
"Espero con ansias verla, gracias a Ethan me hice una fan de los doramas. Si necesitan traductor de ingl¨¦s a espa?ol, estar¨¦ feliz en colaborar "
"Gostei muito, principalmente pelos protagonistas: excelentes! A parte dos coadjuvantes achei fraca e sem interesse. A parte relativa ¨¤ prepara??o das comidas ¨¦ maravilhosa e muito interessante. O tratamento dado aos vil?es da est¨®ria achei muito brando e tenho certeza que a maioria das pessoas ficar¨¢ revoltada com isso. No geral, um bom dorama."
"Love this show. Each character has a vivid personality, the food and cooking always make me droling, I am even inspired by quite a few dishes and learn some knowledge about the food. Well done."
Another disappointing drama for start of 2022.  We waited a year for this weak release.  ML and FL are a real couple so the drama should have really been able capitalize on this.  Too many  issues to even believe this was not a low budget creation.
"thought this was a good series. just a couple of annoying scenes and characters. seemed like the ""foreign"" characters were acting a bit over the top; the dubbing mainly on Victor when he was singing and Elise  could have been better and the last episode seemed to be rushed a bit - could have had been more interesting, but overall  i did enjoy it."
I love shows about food!  I wish there was a little bit more romance because the chemistry was definitely there.  I still enjoyed it!!!   The ending was ¡®different¡¯ but I¡¯m glad the ML survived and it was a HEA ending ????????
Loved this show.awesome scenes of food. Loved the storyline. Most of actors were great. Especially main leads. looks like the whole cast had fun at the ending scenes. Girls singing voice a little odd but unique. I actually like the main song. " Love is the food for living heart.
"8 episodes in and I love this drama.  It¡¯s nothing like the Tipsy drama everyone keeps comparing it to.  As for this drama, I like the complex characters and complex relationships.  I imagine this is competitive the Chef industry and cooking reality shows are.  I especially loved the cooking and food scenes.  I found this drama because of ËÎ×æ¶ù and was surprised that Ethan Juan was the ML.  It¡¯s been like ages since I¡¯ve seen him in anything.  I though they had great chemistry and their relationship is far greater than some cheap romance.  I haven¡¯t seen a drama (I only understand Chinese) like this so I found it to be unique and am really enjoying it.  I highly recommend"
"In general Chinese comedy are bad, but this movie was relaxing, like a movie for a weekend. 
The f lead did not annoyed me how happens in other movies. 
It was good all in all. I love Jing Tien Ruran, he is so sweet, handsome and talented. 
By the way, Victor¡¯s playback was¡­..awful  never seen something like that 
Aaa I read in real life they are a couple "
OMG this was wonderful¡­amazing story line and Phenomenal acting by All characters!!
"17 episodes watched and i am really disappointed. First 5 episodes were really good and then main characters became very annoying. Woman who is so much in love that doing eerything to loose this love, man who has mental problems, lady who let a man treat her like nothing. sorry, it's not for me, devil sister, rich guy who looks like doing nothing all the time. This show is just not for me..."
"Love that you will never feel that he is much older than her. I love the way the story was written. I have learn a lot about the Chinese Cuisine. This definitely a feel good series, hopefully you will have more. This also learning a lot of things about Chinese Culture."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this drama. The food scenes were interesting and delicious looking. It was great to see the growth of the characters. Of course, it would have been good to see the evil people get more of what was coming to them, but it was a show, so I will get over it. The love stories were varied and I liked the development of each story."

"Loved every episode, especially the sweet ending!"
Por favor legendas em portugu¨ºs ????????????????????????????????
"Perfectly decent drama. Cooking and romance, and a competition. And a few unlikable characters that are trying to get in the way of the main leads. 
A sweet fl who¡¯s not the usual ¡°hey, I¡¯m 24, so I¡¯m ditzy and do stupid things repeatedly¡±. Yes she¡¯s young but she actually has a head on her shoulders. 
The ml is quite stereotypical though. Cold and angry on the surface but kind underneath. He¡¯s in pain, you know, and just needs the spunky girl to break through his defenses. He¡¯s really hot though so I can deal with the stereotype. 

A little warning. It has one of the cheesiest endings I have ever seen. Cringe worthy."
"40 episodes of mouth-watering food porn lovingly, brilliantly photographed.  All the actors did a great job.  Widened my horizons re: the remarkable depth and breadth of Chinese cuisine.  Although the story line seemed to get a bit off-track and far-fetched, I still enjoyed the series.  Kudos to all the actors for their hard work and all those working behind the scenes to bring the cuisine, restaurant front and back ends, and all those who labor in the food supply chain to life.  We need to be reminded to appreciate the passion, hard work, artistry, and love involved in putting food on our tables."
"I binged over a few days as the story gently pulled me along. The actors may have a larger age gap in reality than the characters do but the chemistry and casting was perfect once you really get into the story. Very sweet love story really. The ML has a vulnerability which is amazing. This is the second drama I¡¯ve watched with this FL and I appreciated her even more after this. 
There were some characters who¡¯s only purpose was to cause obstacles but in the end, I felt their treatment was very much as I¡¯ve come to expect from cdramas. Resolution comes with understanding and sometimes, forgiveness. The idea of retribution rarely is black and white but rather more nuanced. 
Food featured heavily in this drama and was beautifully shown all through rather than just being an incidental part of the story."
"Let's be honest if it wasn't for Jiang poor Lin fingers would be gone , she's always spaced out looking elsewhere when he's teaching her to cut lol. I will rate this drama again when it ends."
Too long.  I was able to skip several chapters and still understand what's was happening.
I  like the story and the couple. Some of the food looks delicious and some I¡¯m not sure what it is. Anyhow it looks like a captivating drama. It grabs my attention so that¡¯s good 
This is the most I have ever   in a drama . I'm on 5 is it worth going any further ? I think not .
Worst Chinese movie I have ever watched. The two main characters don¡¯t have chemistry but they look cute. I don¡¯t recommend this. No moral lesson
"Serial ogl?da?am po kawa?ku na bie??co gdy si? pojawia?. Lubi? temat mi?o?ci i jedzenia podany na jednej tacy. Negatywnych postaci by?o sporo, dramat¨®w r¨®wnie? ale szcz??liwie mamy happy end. Polecam"
Cute drama but had two many  unnecessary episodes that were boring. Cute lead couple.
"I¡¯ve read the novel, and was disappointed that they didn¡¯t stick to the original story,  but then again¡­ I¡¯m open for surprises, I hope this version doesn¡¯t let me down.  Will marathon once done.  Oh well 30 more episodes to go."
"I completely agreed with most of the reviews about this C-drama. Kesong and Jiang make a great couple and it¡¯s worth watching each episode as they develop feelings for each other. However, there¡¯s too many over-the-top villains that make it difficult to endure. Justice and consequences for bad behavior never seems to enter into the narrative. Otherwise, this is nice romance seasoned with excellent cooking recipes."
"I am throwing shade here¡­.. the lead role goes to the food. The storyline while interesting could have been wrapped up in 20 episodes, tops."
"Well done C-Drama!  Wonderful acting leading roles!  Truly enjoy watching!
Thank you team for English translation making it possible to watch and understanding the meaning of word!"
"Very long, unrealistic, boring drama with no resolution of the conflicts in the plot and three criminals waltzing feely about at the end. It would have been a 3 if it were not for the acting of some of the characters and the gorgeous food."
"This drama is really dragging! Started out really promising, but now it's like nothing new. I don't know why it's called cupids kitchen because there is no romance."
Just completed episode 3 so far the story is good. Like both male and female lead. Looking forward to rest of the episodes.????????????????
Good story with a host of cute characters and villians. This series has a nicely pace and lots of cooking for foodies to drool over.  Playfully romantic  and suspenseful ?rama. The only thing I I hated was 4?44qathat even evil doers got a happy ending.
Trying to figure out why I pay Viki. Watched while series and finished it on YouTube. Disappointed with the ending rushed per usual and stupid
Was this a parody with a cast of EXTREMELY  BAD actors and Ethan Juan??!!!  I should have bypassed this BS and gone  directly to YouTube to view beautiful food display and exceptional cooking !!
"Song zu er is not FL material, unless it is a high school drama. Have watched several of her dramas, and she always seems immature. Friend zone is best for her, also, Ethan deserves better. So hard to watch, very cringy. Will watch something else, with Ethan in it. That boy can act!"
"????????So , so good!! Lots of emotional ups and  downs.  I loved all the actors.  You will experience laughter, tears, frustration, and at times anger, but this is a great series and well worth your time. I was hooked from episode one.  One of the best endings ever."
"Loved this show, but too many unnecessary storylines. Could have been way better without the brother/anorexic bike lady, doctor/Elise, mom/mentor stuff. Didn¡¯t add to the story and just extended episodes."
Ending is so corny! Ending should not end with dancing.
"I loved the ending of the final episode¡­totally unexpected but great     

I just felt that Elise should have ¡°gotten her just desserts¡±  then again the final episode reflected how the main male lead ¡°our chef¡± changed because of his love for ¡°Little Bun¡±."
"In Cupids Kitchen, the scenes of food (& making food) are very well executed and beautiful... the soundtrack ties everything together. This show makes me happy and hungry at the same time. 

Unfortunately I found some editing problems with some of the scenes and just found them to be a little akward. 

Love the female lead & male lead chemistry.  Can't wait to see FL character develop into a more mature person. "
I think this was more of a cooking show than anything else. If I want to see that I¡¯ll watch the food channel. Didn¡¯t feel much chemistry between the ML and FL. Besides the story was dragged on too long based on a  flimsy premise .
"I would have given a higher rating but the Bollywood-ish ending was just odd not to mention the poorly acted character of Elise - just horrible. Otherwise, I loved the male and female lead in this!!!!"
"This drama started out really interesting, but sadly it just became too much of a roller coaster ride. I fast forwarded through so many episodes hoping it would get better, but that just didn¡¯t happen. "
So much extra drama and the end showed how tired the writer was. Not worth seen
Loved the characters and the feel good spirit ao that everyone is redeemed in some way. The cooking scenes are spectacular give me the best sense I've had in a drama of the skills and joy that goes into Chinese cooking.

Thanks to ALL moderators, translators and to the entire Viki crew who make viewing possible."
"Overall , the drama was good. I had some tears at the end. The only negative review I¡¯d like to point out was the dubbing. The female supporting actress¡¯s acting and voiceover was not on point. At times, she spoke Mandarin and at times I believe it was in English but it was dubbed only in Mandarin. Not sure if it was her real voice or not. "
Loved it! Great chemistry between them. Passion for chefs great!! Ethan is so handsome in this---gets more sexy with age! Great skinship!!!
"So many issues with this show. Suffered from poor editing. Justice wasn¡¯t served, what happened to the guy that was arrested? Her cousin never apologised to her or explained, Elise never apologised, what happened to her fringe? And WHY WHY the dance off at the end?? Just felt like they dragged it out for 40 episodes and then rushed it at the end. Poor ."
"I¡¯m on episode 8 and I¡¯m really enjoying this drama,aside from some ridiculous scenes and awful dubbing I will just FFW.  I can¡¯t wait to see more romance, the leads have great chemistry."
"I enjoy watching this drama.
I give 10 stars  because  I really enjoy
See  dramas that  make food competition  and I think  all the actors 
Did a wonderful  Job and deserve my appreciation  for  their hard work.
??????????"
"I usually wait for the series to complete, with C-dramas. Love everything about this show so far!  So captions now or later I'll  definitely be following this series till the end! "
"It was a great story with great acting. Lots of drama with the different personalities. Loved it. The title for the drama seems weak, should have more impactful name. I would recommend this drama for everyone to watch."
"That was beautiful! I liked how it was realistic to see in a way how emotions develop , very subtle. I liked main leads¡¯ expressions and playfulness. Had to binge watch it in few days. It was a treat.. and all that yummy food ???? heart melting series. I fully recommend"
"An exceptionally good drama! The theme of gourmet food, competition, jealousy and forgiveness were very balanced and exciting! Then watching relationships as they developed was just the whipped cream with a delicious cheery on top!"
"Estou ansiosa para assistir lendo a sinopse, por¨¦m vou aguardar a legenda em portugu¨ºs PT - Brasil"
I really enjoyed watching this series. There were a lot of times where I got aggravated with some of the characters and I was also upset about some people not getting what they deserved but all in all it was a good series and I do recommend it
"This was a solid 8 for me. I thought the storyline was good, but they drug out the poisoning plot for way too long. I wanted Elise to get caught and ML to punish her. I feel like she got off way too lightly whether she regretted it or not. The leads were cute together despite the age gap and the romance was nicely presented throughout the drama. All in all, everyone had a happy ending and it was a nice watch."
There was way too much evilness from Elise and Kesong¡¯s cousin. This show would have been so much better without the jealousy and conniving. It also could have been told in less than 40 episodes. I love the main leads and looking fires to more shows with the FML. I loved her in Fly with you which is why I watched this show.
When I saw the main Character I didn't think it was a  good match but as episodes goes on its get better and better!  Very addictive and very good drama!  
"Hermosa historia de amor, el actor es lindo y  la actriz muy tierna, hacen una buena pareja, las im¨¢genes de comida se ven muy agradables y apetitosa"
While the number of episodes would make you think twice to decide to watch you'll be glad you watched. It is like a rollercoaster ride with many turns and hills and valleys.  Emotions are explored and in the end all are satisfied and happy.
"The two leads just don't ""click"" as a  couple, no chemistry. The female love rival is just terrible. I am only watching because of Ethan Juan. Just loved him in The Legend of Fuyao!"
"Kept me interested throughout.  Last episode had the most unique ending of a Chinese drama that I have ever seen.  Personally the very end didn¡¯t do anything for me.  However, it left on on a very positive note.  Many in the comments were not happy with what happened to Elise.  I personally am on the fence about that.  Nicely done."
"I couldn't even make it to 20 episodes. They have to many subplots, and the main story line gets convoluted. If not for the actors, I would give this a 4. ML and FL are excellent, top-notch actors, they are worth the 2 extra stars."
Ethan and Zu Er's chemistry is more like brotherly and sisterly love but they're so cute together.. Ethan's still handsome... Still can't get over his smile.. so cute.... ??
I really enjoyed this drama I wish the romance would of gotten more romantic way before it started getting close to the ending of the show!! But other then that it was amazing !! The acting was so good especially the intense scene with the pills !! And the hospital ugh had me balling like a baby !! So good recccomend everyone watch !!
Great actors but a really really terrible story. I can't believe I sat through it all.
Excellent story and by far one of the most lovable romantic drama I've ever seen along with an exotic journey through the fantastic cuisine of China
Great. Love this. Thanks viki for english sub.
I love food! This has been a very interesting and fun drama to watch! I watched and see if the next event would go as I expected or not. Enjoyed watching this drama tremendously. <3
Estou amando pessoal voc¨ºs poderiam fazer a grande gentileza de colocar legenda em portugu¨ºs estou passando mal de tanta ansiedade kkkkkkk muito bonitinho  fofo o seriado por favor amados
The gourmet food looked AMAZING and there so much creatity in the art of cooking.  Really opened my eyes to how appealing food could be.  The love stories were cute.  Highly recommend watching this if you¡¯re a foodie.
This is the worse movie ever. Im on episode 18 and can't watch anymore.  How can a doctor covered up soneone crime.  Horrible movies. Stop watching it.
Una serie espectacular. La actuaci¨®n es de lujo. Las recetas un manjar.  Todo perfecto
"From the episodes that are actually translated this show seems very typical. There¡¯s nothing unique about it. The lead actress is extremely juvenile until it¡¯s unbelievable. On top of that there are about 5 episodes without subtitles. 

My main critique is for VIKI. THEY REALLY SUCK. FOR PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION , I still can¡¯t get subtitles. I pay as much for VIKI as I do Netflix and can¡¯t even watch the show the day it comes out. They really need to do better!!!!!!!"
"Gostei da performance dos atores. Especialmente as cenas dram¨¢ticas do Ethan Juan. Ele consegue realmente apresentar de forma natural o choro, o desespero, a satisfa??o, o orgulho. Parab¨¦ns!"
"Love the pace and the storyline. Well 

I love the story outline and pace. Clearly portrayed the different in human temperament and enjoyed seeing foreigners actors too. Good script and acting, totally 10 stars."
"watching this I seen most his dramas ,I just can't see him and her together there not good match maybe towards the end it change my mind but as of now they should pick someone else's"
"This is a fun loving, comedy romance about food, family we have and choose, ideals and how we as people can change our destinies. And how even when life through us down we can still find our own way to get back up."
Loving the show so far.  Thanks to the subbers for your hard unpaid work. Can someone plz translate ep5 to english? It got skipped
Subt¨ªtulos en espa?ol por favor!!!! Amo a Ethan Juan
So many twists and turns.  In the end love wins!
"Semplicemente l ho visto tutto d un fiato!!! Bello bello bello, bravissimi gli attori e la storia mi ha fatto piangere in certe scene. E le ricette, mamma mia loro cucinavano e io le mangiavo nella mia immaginazione mi mancher¨¤ questo drama!!!!"
"Buen drama, el actor principal me encanta, la actriz principal PARA MI GUSTO muy ani?adada en actuaci¨®n, di¨¢logos y voz chillona... Me hubiera gustado una actriz un poco m¨¢s madura para ese rol..."
"Ethan is, as ever, brilliant !!!! He is a charismatic, and handsome, elegant, intense, actor. I love him in everything . What's disturbing, is that the female lead , (a good actress,) but has an unfortunate face, with protruding top teeth and a pointy nose . Every so often there's an expression which looks like a rodent in a cartoon. ML, is truly handsome,FL, isn't."
"The main females character is annoying, and it doesn¡¯t give you the urge to continue watching but because of the main lead and the different dishes also the story line make you decide to finish it. The main female lead is very annoying"
"Habe aufgeh?rt zu schauen. Nicht nur, dass Elise eine toxische Frau ist, ein Arzt der die Vergiftung seines Patienten auch noch deckt? Furchtbar, und in den meisten chinesischen Serien endet das auch noch ohne Konsequenzen f¨¹r die T?ter. Will ich gar nicht erst sehen."
"Amei a hist¨®ria, instigante no in¨ªcio, por¨¦m nos faz ter mais aten??o nos acontecimentos e amizades com mais cautela , poderia ter mais cenas romanticas ."
"everyone is being too judgmental this is a drama, and the two leads are doing a great job."
em portugu¨ºs quando???? estou aguardando
I love this drama. Hope I can watch a  episode 2 soon as subtitle is available ??????
"Like  many Chinese dramas coming from the Mainland I know that everything is censored. I must say that I give them points for the racially mixed cast, but the amount of plastic surgery and botox is ridiculous. At least the main male and female leads look normal.  I find these dramas very Westernized and trying to hard to push these western idles like with the choice of music (some of it very corny). This is way I prefer watching traditional fantasy dramas with actors flying through the air and making make-believe myth stories. My reason for watching Korean, Japanese and Chinese dramas is to experience a different point of view of the world not the same one I am living in here in the USA. It's so obvious that they are marketing to Westerners and of course young gullible girls and it's about making money.  The Chinese need to make their own dramas and stop copying and taking from Korean and Japanese dramas.              Aside from all that, I guess it's a cute drama and the main leads are pleasant to look at. The villains had major surgery to the point of looking like monsters, but I think that was intentional. I will go back and watch dramas from Taiwan and Hong Kong."
I will just watch after  all the episodes are finish. Right now I'm still watching the  LEGEND  OF FUYAO ( for the 3rd times to watch ). I'm in episode  39 & enjoying it to much.
"Love this , so mild story????????????????????????????????????"
"Cade as legendas em pt???????  ja ta quase no final, e nada!"
Very good drama - some things a bit lost - and did not fit or get answered - final sign off missing 2 people - would have been good if event was streamed and we saw them watching.  Did I enjoy it - definitely - was FML & ML good - yes - I did think the early episodes the best - as it was setting the interactions between main cast - some scenes predictable but well worth watching this drama - will I watch again - yes
Much better than some Korean shows which have gotten  higher ratings.  No loud and obnoxious characters. Good development of all the roles by the writers and actors. Read one review about how the villains of the piece should end up which was very amusing. Has kept me engaged even with the side stories.
It's a good watch. The acting is great. The story line with their push and pull relationship does drag out too long in my opinion. BUT WHY THE DANCING AT THE END?! that can't possibly be the actual song they played for those dancers lol i was cracking up at the intensity of dance to orchestra music 
Beautifully done. Gorgeous cinematography I couldn¡¯t stop watching. Loved it ??????????????????????
"I really enjoyed it, Boris certainly made me laugh, loved the characters, good drama and easy to watch, well done all who took part and a huge thank you to the interpreters."
"Really cute, out of the normal playings that we are into. Specially cause is told thru the FL eyes. Dancing felt kind strange but thats the result of good food n love that always brings joys and happiness."
"I absolutely love this show!!! The ending is amazing!!!!
Thanks for making such a great story available to the rest of us. "
This is a wonderful show.I love historical drama¡¯s but this show was a nice change
Got incredibly far fetched and rather stupid in the last 8 or so episodes.
"I thoroughly enjoyed this drama.  Both the male and female leads performed well and I thought the script and story were well written, however I felt there were too many evildoers."
"Esta empezando a aburrirme , cap¨ªtulos que no pasan  de lo mismo ?¡â?,000 romance , ella cada d¨ªa mejor , sin duda ella es la mejor esto este drama ?¡â?"
"Dramat sam w sobie bardzo dobry, nie podoba?o mi si? ,?e sprawczyni ca?ego zamieszania zosta?a wydalona z Chin i tak naprawd? nie ponios?a kary  no ale mo?na i tak  , szkoda ?e w?tki pobocznych postaci  w ostatnim odcinku zosta?y pospiesznie pozamykane , zako¨½czenie - co to by?o, taniec?  Taniec wcale nie pasuje do zako¨½czenia .Kto? chcia? by? kreatywny  i niestety si? nie uda?o .
Og¨®lnie drama mi si? podoba?a  gra aktorska i chemia mi?dzy aktorami bardzo dobra ,polecam"
"Me encanta la serie, es muy ¨¢gil y moderna, pero me gustar¨ªa cu¨¢ndo estar¨¢n disponibles todos los cap¨ªtulos con subt¨ªtulos en espa?ol. Muchas gracias"
Just LOVE it! It¡¯s like dating in the kitchen but more intense drama.!
Favor legendar. Sou assinante plus e tenho que ver em Fansubs porque a equipe viki t¨¢ lenta demais.
I just love this drama.   I loved the story line.  The actors were also great.  Makes me want to learn to cook different things.
"Legenda em portugu¨ºs ,por favor."
Great loved it.. glad there was a happy ending.
"Jest started EP-1, it has the girl Kesong running and hiding from the man in the room, she works in the hotel why run and hide? (is this a standard thing with these movies you run and hide from people you don't know. will continue watching to see it turns out. (give a three for now)"
Hate de d¨¦couvrir ce nouveau drama..avec des acteurs dont le jeu est tr¨¨s naturel dumoins c est ce que j ai vu dans d autres s¨¦ries.. .merci viki pour vos traductions
Very different story line comparing to others. It's refreshing to watch. It's still early to rate it so far but I give a thumb up as of episode 9
"Nice storyline with some twistplots. Endearing, sometimes saddening, humor and a romantic touch. Overall enjoyable to watch"
Comecei a assistir esse drama e achei um absurdo o tratamento do prota com a mocinha .No tempo de hoje ningu¨¦m aceita isso .Gostei das imagens das comidas a variedades e riquezas das comidas t¨ªpicas .E parei de assistir n?o gosto desse tipo de tratamento com as pessoas.
I love ?? to watching they¡¯re dancers ?¡á??¡á??¡á??¡á??¡á??¡á??¡á??¡á??¡á??¡á? fantastic and amazing 
"Definitely worth watching, great way of portraying hospitality and their chemistry and acting I think is on point. You don't feel like they are trying so hard to make the scene, I  noticed it's very natural and realistic ?¡â?"
"Great drama especially have a wonderful chemistry, especially if they put more romantic scene wow super high drama. Waiting for next project for the two of them"
"the story is good, i wish i could watch soon

Translate frensh and  other language please thank you very much "
"Simplesmente foi um dorama  emocionante, atores maravilhosos. Mas gostaria que a legenda fosse em portugu¨ºs, pois meu ingl¨ºs ¨¦ p¨¦ssimo."
????????????????????????????????????????
Ich bin von dem was ich gesehen habe begeistert. Ich hoffe der deutsche Untertitel wird dann aufschluss geben was sich in den langen Dialogen verbirgt.
Very nice romantic comedy and drama all in one
"THE FOOD SCENES ARE REALLY SPECTACULAR¡­¡­..THEY REALLY GOT IT RIGHT. 

THE STORY WASN¡¯T WRITTEN VERY WELL. SOME OF THE CHARACTERS¡¯ DIDN¡¯T ADD MUCH TO ENHANCE THE STORY & I WAS ESPECIALLY ANNOYED WITH ELISE¡¯S STORY & THE CONSEQUENCES OF HER ACTIONS. THE MUSICAL SEQUENCE AT THE END CAME OUT OF LEFT FIELD & DIDN¡¯T SEEM TO FIT AT ALL!

THE ML & FL HAD GREAT CHEMISTRY & REALLY HAD A BELIEVABLE WORKING & ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP."
"Creo q el drama engancha, pero no entiendo q ponga subtitulos en espa?ol, cuando s¨®lo est¨¢n los 5 primeros"
"Love the story line, happy to see how a great chef is made, if this is true how they showed it. Love their gardens, the complete modern kitchen, how he trained her & their personal relationship that they had kept bottled up. Hate Else for her vendetta. Can¡¯t imagine how a person could be so wicked as to poison him.. She¡¯s lucky that they forgave her. At least the ending was great for Little Bun & Jiang. Great acting.????"
"Ethan Juan and Song Zu Er were absolutely brilliant in this delicious film about
haute cuisine and the people who create it.  The story was intriguing and all the actors
did a superb job in their roles.  For me, this is one of the best films ever although painful
to watch at times - that's how realistic it was!"
The food scenes were great.  The main characters story was fill with love.  I like the street food area.
"Interesting, Intense story on cooking. Competitive characters , annoying at times.  Good lessons to learn. Overall, nice endings."
"Interesting to watch, compared it with dating in the kitchen and can confirm both story lines are unique. Can¡¯t wait for the rest of the episodes."
I like both of the leading actors but the writing wasn't the best for me. I think the leading actors did a fantastic job and the production was good as well.
Why did it feel like the ending was rushed? There could have more.
This was a really nice show the actors and actresses did a very nice job
"O cen¨¢rio, roteiro, m¨²sica e elenco ¨¦ encantador, aguardo ansiosa as legendas em portugu¨ºs, mas vendo antes mesmo. Gratid?o pelo trabalho ."
"Pelo trailer parece muito bom.
Vamos aguardar pelas legendas em portugu¨ºs, enquanto isso vamos assistir outros que j¨¢ foram legendados.
"
"Wonderful series to watch super cast, script and production ... I want to visit China even more "
"The Main leads are well matched considering the age gap here loads of interesting and colourful food, intrigue on who instigated the poison? Probably obvious but maybe a hidden player, Ethan Juan wow sold it "
"La decepci¨®n del 2022, terrible historia"
"I love this show! The main FL is so cute and loveable. The main ML is so handsome. All the cast members act quite well, it's a light hearted realistic, melodrama. Sometimes I think there was some weird dubbing over a few characters but nothing to put you off. Watch it!!"
queria saber porque nao tem todos os epsodios com legenda em portuges so tem ate o 7 .???????
"This is a love song to food and those who prepare it at the highest levels. Yes there are plenty of love stories along the way too, but they are of the more sweet nature than steamy."
"Por favor, traduzam para Portugu¨ºs-br logo, estou mt ansiosaa"
"This drama has had to of had the absolute best ending I have ever seen.
It was so painful at times to watch because of the hard ships the main leads had to go through, so the ending just brought absolute joy and happiness.
Thank you for the people that did the subtitles we really appreciate it great"
"It's story is like gift, full of surprises that makes you so excited and feel loved.  Love conquers all in life and to who or whatever ur goals are."
Age difference of leads are too far apart.
Lovely drama for entire family ?????????????????????????
"Gostaria de assistir,  quando estar¨¢ dispon¨ªvel a legenda em portugu¨ºs?????"
Quiero verla en espa?ol gusta  trama buen actor
Great actors.  Ethan is terrific. This is a beautiful love story. I love the showcase of superb Chinese cuisine.
I don¡¯t like the ending. How come it became musical at the end
I really enjoyed this drama it was different and fun last episode a little funky but you can't have everything 
No English subtitles a times when you wanted to read. Missed the storyline
I love this show ??
O dorama ¨¦  muito bom . S¨® tem legenda at¨¦ o epis¨®dio 5. Legenda em portugu¨ºs por favor. Desde ja agrade?o.
I have  given the show 10 stars even tho I am only on #23. Love to cook so learning quite a bit. So far FLx3 are just as bitchie as the guys are stooooooopid. Surprised they get anything done. More later.
"Tem tudo para ser ¨®timo,por¨¦m n?o est¨¢ 100% dublado em portugu¨ºs por isso e minha avalia??o"
"was there another drama like this some years ago? this looks & sounds so familiar
but still love it!"
"Hist¨®ria leve, sutil e sem muitas pieguices! Que continue assim. Ansiosa para o surgimento do romance entre os 2!"
Me encant¨®.. la qu¨ªmica de los principales es la mejor. Pero el final porque siempre tiene que ser tan apresurado y un poco irreal.
Amazing! If only they kissed like 2022 and not 1922 then it would a 10 
If people are new to Viki I would recommend this show for you to watch. Everyone worked so good in this show. I will watch it again. I have already sent it out to a few of my friends. Ethan Juan is so great in this show but I like his acting. The cast was really great. There was never a moment where you didn't loose interested.
"I like it very much!! Both actors complement each other! And, on top at all I ve learn some tricks in the kitchen... You have to prepare yourself and eat something prior seeing each episode.. with so much cooking you go hungry everytime :):):)"
I watch cupids kitchen from episode 1-40 with English subtle in you tube. Very nice storyline and ending is the best. ??????
Not good at all waste of time this should just have been 10 episodes good actor but reall bad written
"Really loving this show ... dislike 2FL though! Often watching episodes without English subtitles, thankful when subtitles have been provided (thank you translators we appreciate you)"
Love!.. love!.. amazing  ????????????????
Moi j¡¯ai ador¨¦ mais j¡¯aurais voulu ?a soit en fran?ais mais c¡¯est correct mais je le recommande ¨¤ d¡¯autres de le regarder ????????????????????
"Sweet romantic drama with twist and turns, would have liked to see a bit more of the couple in the ending, but overall it was good "
Amazing story with love for food and the detailed of preparing them.
"Very entertaining, educational and I enjoyed the many cookery tips and visuals. Nice story. This series  had it all. Thank you so much"
Female lead too childish for my liking...love Ethan but can't watch anymore.
"America? I am confused, the setting does not look like America at all. Maybe is more in the future?"
I absolutely loved this story line and the actors and actress' that stared in it. Great Job!!!
"I loved this show very much. It had drama, humour and love. The actors were all superb and played their parts very well. Well done!!!"
Please make the sec season. Thank you USA Las Vegas Nevada love the show and I¡¯m Christian Wade. IG DW_ Roberson
"love the food it is amazing,  the main characters for the main part are great actors but the casting for the parts was not to well chosen for me the girl was to young for the part I was not able to enjoy it so I stop view it , I give a ten for the fantastic food they prepare ( my favorite food is Chinese  )"
A Cozinha de Cupido muito bom gosto Meu Cora??o 
pas encore regard¨¦ j attend la traduction en fran?ais j ai hate de le voir
"This series is average among the many I have watched and loved.  Average mainly because of the storyline flaws.  The ending is just garbage writing.  So I¡¯m sorry I invested so much time watching the series.  

Subtitles: Viki advertises that they provide subtitles in 150 languages. Therefore this should not be done by volunteers.  Those who pay have a right to comment that the service advertised is not well provided. I pay the monthly subscription. 
"
I love it I will look at the series again the main man and woman were excellent and the other men and women were great I really enjoyed it I cried a little bit I laugh a little bit but I enjoyed it and believe lady is very pretty
Muita demora para traduzir mas maravilhoso
I'm so in love with Ethan Juan. So far I  really love this drama and can't wait for the next episode. I just wish I can understand it without subtitles. 
"se ve super el trailer, por favor traducir en espa?ol, cuandoempieza traduccion es espa?ol ........"
"I don't know if I will continue to watch this drama. The FL is so annoying with her facial expressions and yelling. Maybe she will settle down after a few episodes.  I would like to see her play in more grown-up roles. The ML has a bad temper, so there is more yelling. I 
 like watching the cooking part. It's not a feel-good drama for me.  The plot is ok and it is decent for the whole family."
I was very disappointed that the last 4 episodes didn't have any english language 
Loved this one so much! The horrible dubbing at times was annoying but the storyline was so good
I like the show.. But where have subtitles gone starting from episode 26 onwards ..l'm upset trying to enjoy the show..
Assistir at¨¦ o sexto e estou gostando que ator ¨®timo e a primeira vez que o vejo em um cdrama !aguardando ansiosa as legendas em portuques! Parab¨¦ns aos tradutores o texto est¨¢ ¨®timo!
Great job of filming how the food are prepared!  Wish there are more episodes.
"It¡¯s a great show. I love the characters 
, the plot and the food. However, I did not feel any chemistry of the two main lead actors."
such a stupid script.  male lead 's emotions swings like a bipolar disorder and can't seem to make decisions clearly.
Love the movie beautiful acting to all actors specially the main characters. Thank you??????
I wish there was more romantic interaction between kesong and quifan in the last episode && more ending instead of the weird flash mob instead..
"Cooking is certainly not my forte, nor something I actively take an interest in, but this show totally sucked me in. Loved it. The ML is so charismatic and worked beautifully with the FL. The filming of food is the best I¡¯ve ever seen, actually. I¡¯d definitely recommend this one. Good story!!"
Pensez vous un sous titrage en fran?ais je suis impatiente!!!
OK I¡¯m really really cute show never got bored I had three days off watched it really is nice and slow and Jeff and the family
"I love love this drama, great cast n storyline! ??????????????????"
I was hoping to see a big wedding but I love it good drama kudos to everyone 
Legenda por amor????????????
"Tiene una fotograf¨ªa muy muy buena, con esas tomas de la comida  me da ganas de ir a china solo para probar todo."
"Por favor subtitulos en espa?ol  
Me encanta Ethan"
"Masterpiece!!!! A real masterpiece!! The emotions, cultures, cuisines, delicacies, and happy ending "
"I love cooking competition shows. There are a few scenes that did not make much sense, but overall, it was good."
POR FAVOR SUSTITULAR EN ESPA?OL POR FAVOR SUSTITULAR EN ESPA?OL POR FAVOR SUSTITULAR EN ESPA?OL    
Elise should have gone to prison for a longtime
If I had to describe in one word¡­ I¡¯d choose *Warmth*
Need a part 2 I love the characters . One of the best shows but it need to continue the show.
Beautiful show. These two characters are so good together very natural seems like they are a real couple
Overall I love it. Technically for food lover and some romance included.
Idk how I feel about the age gap of the two main lead¡­he is old enough to be her Dad¡­
What happened to young assistant who was arrested..? Learned a lot about cooking
"English translation too long even for ONE episode!
And there are 40!
Volunteers or not, it's really not serious VIKI! No respect for people who pay a subscription."
I loved the show until 35 when it began to drag. Luckily it picked 2 episode later. Great job to the whole cast they did awesome together.   ?      ? 
Me encanto este drama la pasi¨®n por la comida de este chef era realmente grandioso simplemente espectacular
"Really cute. Loved all the cooking segments. But did not feel the chemistry, not like Dating in the Kitchen."
"Lovable characters. Thank you to the creators, director, actors and the bts staff. Great job! I am a satisfied and a very happy viewer!"
"10 because I absolutely adore Ethan. Story line is predictable but  again Ethan. Its the acting and the visual, he's just good and so enjoyable to watch :0)"
"Animada sim ou claro 
Dorama chineses s?o os meus favoritos?"
Loved it.The ending was a little disconnected to the story with the dancers but the cast was great and enjoyed the music.
I liked it but the ending could have been better it should have had a wedding but t not the dance
"Nossa muito legal estou muito ansiosa pelo pr¨®ximo cap¨ªtulo, gosto muito d3dsa atriz."
Lindo. Entretenido y me encant¨® nos ense?a sobre el arte culinario de su pa¨ªs
Traduzam porque ¨¦ muito bom! A hist¨®ria ¨¦ divertida demais.
Love love loved this series would watch again an recommend a great watch
"Woy boy ! ban mwen y tou cho! Mi bon drama en kannani ! 

Ce drama a combl¨¦ toutes mes attentes ! Je ne serai pas ¨¦tonn¨¦e qu'il fasse parti des meilleurs de l'ann¨¦e ! un r¨¦gal !!!!!!"
Ethan Juan got better with age. This is by far his best drama.
Love their love for each other like the transition was smooth and cute
Loved the story beautiful love story filled with joy and love
Five for all the potential this show has and squandered trying to reach 40+ episodes.
That was a cute story  loved the cast Especially the main cast
Gostei t? super empolgada para assistir o restante coloca a legenda em portugu¨ºs aparti do ep. 6 s¨® tem em ingl¨ºs por favor ai dou as 10 estrelas.
En attente de traduction en fran?ais avant de d¨¦buter
"For the sake of Song Zu Er & Ethan Juan (main leads) I will rate this drama a 9 ?? only because they great actors, but I found out that the plot was kinda to long for 40 episodes, I won't denied that it was very tense & irked but it was worth it to watch at time!"
"Okay, I've made it to ep 29 and all I can say is enough already! Too many villains in this cdrama.  But the one villain that I really can't stand is the doctor.  How,  just how can they portray such an unprofessional, dangerous unethical character. He has no shame and continues to treat the patient, disgusting! For me the food is the main lead.  If it wasn't for the food I'd have stopped watching long ago"
Porfavor p?e legenda em portugu¨ºs portugu¨ºs portugu¨ºs.......................................?...
Me encanto teniaun drama bonito y mientras lo ve¨ªas mas queria saber de la drama los felicito.
Sicuro mi piacer¨¤  sareste cos¨¬ gentili  di mettere sottotitoli in italiano Graze
"I really liked it! Took away one star because of the ending, could have been better¡­"
It¡¯s really good so far. Not too much of the usual romance drama troupes. Light and entertaining and the food looks so good 
It was so cute and sad at the same time they had a lot of up and downs but In the end it all worked out in the end
I finish it because it was nice to see the cooking  and  Ethan Juan  but it was a little silly sometimes
Loved Episode 1 but please let's have English Subs. Thanks
"I liked it but I didn¡¯t like how Elise didn¡¯t pay for what she did, so I didn¡¯t like the end."
The characters look very nice.  I am looking forward to watching it.
The beginning was interesting and cool but at the ending it was another story
I love so much...only two to go...don't want it to end...
"Liking this a lot with two of my favorite leads ??. Clearly you can see love triangle brewing lol.  But, enjoying and it seems fun to watch. Thought I ended comments, but must add ----- WTH the FL is on my last nerve WHEW! Cuz, the ML -- Jeezus :(  they are making hard to enjoy watch the dumbness. The positive, learning new ways to cook...rating is dropping for me.  This show has changed. Dragging and has wasted scenes.  I¡¯ve been fast forwarding since Lin got locked in the car.  Done with it.  Rate dropped to a 5 for teaching me new cooking skills.  Now the show just fell off the cliff. Nothing was resolved with Elise, her mom forged signatures, cuz behavior was not addressed, Y was arrested, Dr caught up with Elise causing ML illnesses¡­the list continues.  No one was held accountable for their actions.  And the ending was on broadway lmao  it was a musical¡ª-really?!!  Would not recommend.  "
Watched 3 times and so many scenes still bring tears to my eyes. Amazing chemistry between the 2 leads
"What a Beautiful Drama... 
I love this Drama so much.

The Ending was Great."
"Traduzione in italiano  Ti prego per favore  , perch¨¦ ¨¨ bella ???"
So beautiful I loved this series all the actors and the scenery were beautiful well done thank you
"T? querendo assistir,  mas n?o t¨¢ legendado nem um epis¨®dio."
Thus far this show keeps me wanting to see more.  I am
"Tr¨¨s bon film  ¨¤ voir et revoir, les acteurs sont excellent et l'histoire passionnante
sous titrage excellent  jusqu'¨¤  l'¨¦pisode 6
Impatiente de voir le reste"
Love it ??????¡­¡­.  ¡­¡­¡­¡­.    ¡­¡­..    ¡­.   ¡­..
Pone que hay sub espa?ol pero solo esta en el tr¨¢iler esta en sub espa?ol pod¨¦is seguir traduciendo por favor es que tengo mucha ganas de verlo por favor ?¡â
I¡¯m loving the cast so far especially the main characters. Can¡¯t wait til the next episode??
Loved the food photography. A decent plot. A poor unimaginative childish ending.
Why did I watch and get addicted to this show only to be slowed down  by this subtitle issue! LOL I am a paying subscriber and have a right to complain. Peace!
"Gostaria de saber quando vai ser traduzido para portugu¨ºs, pois pago  aqui no Brasil esperando ver os doramas em portugu¨ºs."
Loved the characters and all the food!I enjoyed these drama all the way to the end.
This could've been a spectacular drama. Both of the ML's got on my nerves at times and I really don't think it was needed.
Read the novel - and although it¡¯s loosely adapted it has its own charm
"Way too many episodes. Some good bits. lots of misery, ridiculous ending of people dancing. Nice looking male lead."
Boa noite! Como fa?o para coloca o idioma portugu¨ºs nos epis¨®dios de A cozinha do cupido?
I'm in love with this drama I wish I could binge straight through.
"Une belle histoire, et belle d¨¦couverte de la cuisine"
Good drama and storyline. Ending ended up being a bit bizarre.
Tradu??o em portugu¨ºs por favor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
por favor coloquem legenda em portugu¨ºs.
"Lovely drama , great ML& FL chemistry & cameo. Just feel the end was a bit rushed"
Storyline became ridiculous towards the end.
"UPDATE Episode 38 with english subtitle 
I hereby want to thank the  people who are against my comment, (thumbs down) that means that my review is read thank you. I have seen this drama on MZTV episode 38 with english subtitle. And i hereby want to change my rating not for the VIKI service but for the drama, the acting and the story. Great Drama ! I need to see 2 more episodes on MZTV, i hope to see Elise pay for what she did. 

I always thought that when your paying for a specific product and it is not delivered on time or has errors and faults, the company make efforts to improve the product, although there are several complaints, this drama remains the same.

Its a pitty because this is a very good drama, great actors, exciting story, but i have to drop this drama for now because i dont understand chinese, and I dont have time to waist, I will resume this drama, when the englisg subtitles are in place."
Story line was to die for best acting happen with n the last 5 episodes.
"its starts off slow in the romance part, but it is a really great show"
"Magnifique,un pur bonheur du d¨¦but ¨¤ la fin,bravo ¨¤ vous tous,des acteurs ¨¦poustouflants,merci pour ce moment de d¨¦tente,continuer dans cette voie,¨¤ bient?t."
"The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was because after so many bad things no one found out who was behind the bad things, and when they did, there was always an excess of kindness and forgiveness on the part of the main characters. Apart from that for a person who had no skill in the kitchen to become so good in such a short time just because she has an excellent palate and a chef as a mentor is very unrealistic. But if you can ignore all this you will have a good experience.."
Great story and great actors! Leads had such chemistry.The filming of the food was beautiful.
Pueden ponerlo en espa?ol es que no veas siempre sin poder verlo
It is really good story but can you give english subtitle pleaee
Lui ¨¨ un troppo figo e lei altrettanto anche come attrice come sempre.
This drama proves love happens in the kitchen. Enjoyed this story a lot!  I didn¡¯t want it to end. Cute ending with the full cast. 
Me encanto en espera de que sea subtitulada espa?ol
Really interesting insight into culinary cooking. Great story. Fan of Shaun Ethan but not the young female apprentice. She not a very good match for main male character.
Very good loved to watch cooking cute couple I think Elise should have been put in jail
"Por favor,  legendas em portugu¨ºs !!! Desde j¨¢,  agrade?o  pela  aten??o!  Assim que legendarem em portugu¨ºs,  poderei avaliar melhor. "
Is very good ????????????????????????????
"I am really liking this drama - both Song Su Er and Ethan are so.

"I skip around a lot but it is a really sweet show, Specially once they admit their feelings..  ;)"
?????con mi 45% de ingles quede encantada.... 40 capitulos de miles de emociones llore ...rei ...me enamore me encanto por completo???
Enjoyed watching  the show. Love character  development.  Im surely going to rewatch once all the english subtitles are available

Definitely worth watching."
"I love this drama. The male lead and female lead are great. I love the matured actors and actresses cast. I would recommend it to any one. By the way, the male lead is too too hot!!!"

"The rating is for the food. The plot, and story telling will get like a 5.5 from me."
I liked it! Had a little bit of everything
"Love the plot and the characters. The visuals of the cooking is amazing, the scenes opened my appetite and Made me so hungry, lol."
"What , I thought there were 38 episodes, I only got to 24.."

Gracias?  pese a todo la perseverancia  pudo mas y el amor.  Brindar una comida deliciosa es amor. Gracias?
"Para cuando los subt¨ªtulos en espa?ol? , tiene buena pinta.. Gracias por su trabajo, "
A little bit more of romance what I made it a 10 star for me.
I Love the beginning to the end of this Drama
"Loved all the cooking and of course the C-Drama.  So progressive for a Mainland China 
Production.  Did anyone in China get to watch this?"
Quando v?o legendas em portugu¨ºs estou esperando muito tempo olhem aqui para n¨®s com carinho ?
Loved the acting of both the main characters. Amazing storyline

She does not go to America. She goes to Shanghai
So cute .You have to watch it .i loved it.

"Amo este Drama!!! full recomendado,

Love this  show already finish all ep. However don¡¯t understand when he stated it¡¯s his illness knowing he was poison.
When will ep 5 have eng sub titles. Ep 6  already has 100% eng sub titles . Very frustrating. thank you for responding to emails about this matter so promptly.  Enjoying this drama and looking forward to remaining episodes.
Por fa traducida a espa?ol   que a un esta subido en ingl¨¦s y no sale a un espa?ol
Loved it. Nice storyline. Good acting. Great actors
hola quiero verla en subtitulos espa?olp
I really enjoyed this C-Drama. Loved main characters.
Excelente!!! ??????????????????????????????????????????
Wow great series laughter all the way throughout
I think everything will fall into place because Lin Kesong is the narrator .   She's telling the story 3 months ago from the time she met Jiang.  But I'm assuming because I rewatched the first Ep and  flashbacks to 3 months ago when it all started.
"No pondr¨¢n la traducci¨®n en espa?ol?
La quiero ver "
"A MUST WATCH MOVIE!  Food lover, food education and romance it can't get any better!"
"Love Ethan, but rushed and unsatisfactory ending."
"Very nice movie, want to watch it over and over again"
"Love it, heart warming and the food scene is awesome!"
"It was a interesting story,we¡¯ll played, good actors I loved it !!"
Great show loved the storyline it was so different
Was amazing! The ending was a little so-so but hood nonetheless 
"Please make a second season! This is the best show I have watched on this app. The storyline is always fresh, they hired perfect actors and I want to see more!"
LOVED this drama ! My top 5   You will grow to love every character
"Please, ch¨¨re fine the song love of food? I love it. Thanks"
Loving it so far! Both the ML and the FL are nailing it!
"legendas em portugu¨ºs  porfavorr

It's a nice series about love and cooking
N?o gostei pq as legendas n?o foram traduzidas para o portugu¨ºs
I usually don't do rating till the whole drama is ended. But this time is exceptional cause its rating is unfairly low.
I can't wait Zhu'er performance with Ethan LOL I bit it's a good drama so i'll give both 10 star
The middle is tough but it ends up like dessert
Por favor URGENTE!!!! Subtitulos en espa?ol... me encant¨® la trama

I enjoyed the 1st episode.   I will update my rating after I watch all 40 episodes.
Prefer a wedding that people dancing comically
"Ethan Juan, I have been waiting patiently¡­<3 <3"
40 episodes too long for this show to havens discounting ending. 
I¡¯m at all the person that realize that she is 16 years younger than him
Por favor si ponen con subt¨ªtulos en espa?ol
I love d this series and I loved the actors .
"Muy buen drama, el argumento es din¨¢mico y entretenido."

I like it but the subtitles are not fast enough

Cad¨º as legendas em portugu¨ºs? Assim fica dif¨ªcil continuar pagando e demorar muito pela legenda
when will the characters eat the food with appetite? feel the food? since it's about taste for food it feels as if the actors are picking on the food :( so many wasted good food
Quando metterete i sub titoli in Italiano?
Excelente muestra la cultura culinaria adem¨¢s ejemplo de amor obst¨¢culos  resueltos
"Por favor coloca legendas em portugu¨ºs
